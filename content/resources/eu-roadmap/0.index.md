Open-source EDA tools play a crucial role in supporting the ambitious objectives of the European Chips Act. By enhancing accessibility and fostering the development of expertise, they also contribute to strengthening technological sovereignty.

The FOSSi Foundation supports a community-wide effort to provide European policy
makers with an actionable roadmap for future funding of the open source EDA
ecosystem ([see our blog post](/blog/2024-08-16-roadmap)). The roadmap process
was driven by a core group of experts that engaged with the community in various
focus areas.

A first version of the roadmap and recommendations was [presented at ORConf 2024
(recording)](https://youtu.be/GNBHe6HSCNs). In the community review period after
this, we have received and incorporated over 70 individual contributions.

Three short-term actions were identified that also conclude the roadmap:

 - Open Source Analogue and Mixed-Signal Designs for Europe
 - Productivity, Interoperability and Verification for more European Chips
 - System-on-Chip Innovation from Europe with Open-Source Digital Chip Design

the future of open source EDA:
