The Foundation’s goals can be achieved with your support in a couple of ways.

* Sponsorship packages - if you’d like to support the FOSSi Foundation by becoming a tiered sponsor, get in touch via sponsoring@fossi-foundation.org and the details on our sponsorship packages.

* Developers - setting up our infrastructure takes work and we’re interested in having more people to lend a hand. See our News & Posts section for the latest requests, or contact us at info@fossi-foundation.org to offer your help maintaining and developing our infrastructure.

* Talk. We encourage discussion on all things open source digital design and FOSSi on the LibreCores discussion mailing list: discussion@lists.librecores.org (subscribe here).

* Individual donations. You can also support us with small donations via Paypal:
