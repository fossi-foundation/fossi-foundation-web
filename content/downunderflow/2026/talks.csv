Sat,11:15,Normal,OpenROAD in the Classroom: RTL to GDS flow,Samuel Tensingh,"This talk shares lessons from one of the early structured uses of the [OpenROAD RTL-to-GDS flow](https://github.com/the-openroad-project) in an Australian ASIC training course delivered through the [Semiconductor Sector Service Bureau (S3B)](https://s3b.au/). The course used a fully open-source flow built around [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) for synthesis, [OpenSTA](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA) for timing analysis, OpenDP for placement, TritonCTS for clock tree synthesis, and TritonRoute for routing. The presentation focuses on practical flow behaviour, setup and integration challenges, and recurring issues observed in real student designs. It concludes with concrete suggestions on how the community can make OpenROAD easier to use, more reliable, and better suited for teaching and large-scale training.",,,

Sat,13:30,Normal,"Slingshot and Slander: Tools for Analysing and Mutating SystemVerilog, Powered by Slang",Matt Young,"SystemVerilog is a challenging language to parse. Thanks to Mike Popoloski's [Slang SV frontend](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang), state-of-the-art FOSS parsing of complex SystemVerilog has been achievable. Using Slang, I present two tools: [Slingshot](https://github.com/mattyoung101/slingshot) and [Slander](https://github.com/mattyoung101/slander). [Slingshot](https://github.com/mattyoung101/slingshot) is a SystemVerilog Language Server Protocol (LSP) with a focus on accurate and fast completion, whereas [Slander](https://github.com/mattyoung101/slander) is a tool for minimising and mutating SV for the purposes of fuzzing.",,
