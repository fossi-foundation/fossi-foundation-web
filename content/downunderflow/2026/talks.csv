Sat,11:15,Normal,OpenROAD in the Classroom: RTL to GDS flow,Samuel Tensingh,"This talk shares lessons from one of the early structured uses of the [OpenROAD RTL-to-GDS flow](https://github.com/the-openroad-project) in an Australian ASIC training course delivered through the [Semiconductor Sector Service Bureau (S3B)](https://s3b.au/). The course used a fully open-source flow built around [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) for synthesis, [OpenSTA](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA) for timing analysis, OpenDP for placement, TritonCTS for clock tree synthesis, and TritonRoute for routing. The presentation focuses on practical flow behaviour, setup and integration challenges, and recurring issues observed in real student designs. It concludes with concrete suggestions on how the community can make OpenROAD easier to use, more reliable, and better suited for teaching and large-scale training.",,,

Sat,13:00,Normal,Lowering barriers to entry to the semiconductor space,Julius Baxter,An exploration of open source tooling IP and flows which greatly reduce the barrier to entry for semiconductor startups informed by Morse Micro's experience circa 2016 to today.,,
Sat,13:30,Normal,"Slingshot and Slander: Tools for Analysing and Mutating SystemVerilog, Powered by Slang",Matt Young,"SystemVerilog is a challenging language to parse. Thanks to Mike Popoloski's [Slang SV frontend](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang), state-of-the-art FOSS parsing of complex SystemVerilog has been achievable. Using Slang, I present two tools: [Slingshot](https://github.com/mattyoung101/slingshot) and [Slander](https://github.com/mattyoung101/slander). [Slingshot](https://github.com/mattyoung101/slingshot) is a SystemVerilog Language Server Protocol (LSP) with a focus on accurate and fast completion, whereas [Slander](https://github.com/mattyoung101/slander) is a tool for minimising and mutating SV for the purposes of fuzzing.",,
Sat,14:00,Normal,hdlworkflow: Seamless FPGA workflows,Scott Huynh,"All HDL simulators follow the same process (analyse, elaborate and simulate) though each uses its own variation of these commands. Similarly, all HDL synthesis tools follow the same flow (synthesise, place and route, and generate bitstream). [hdlworkflow](https://github.com/scottshuynh/hdlworkflow) abstracts away these tool-specific commands, making project setup and usage fast and effortless.",,
Sat,14:30,Normal,Hardware Hackademia - Open-Source Hardware Security Education at UNSW,Hammond Pearce,"In 2025 I launched COMP6420 Hardware Security at UNSW. This new course explores the principles and practices of hardware security, covering topics such as side-channel attacks, hardware trojans, cryptographic implementations in hardware, and more. Everything is designed around practical hands-on experiences and labs, ensuring that students not only learn the theoretical aspects of hardware security but also how to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios. In this talk, I will discuss how I achieved this through the use of the open-source OSS-CAD-Suite as well as the development of a bespoke educational hardware platform, the Hackster, which I also release under CC BY-SA.",,
