## FOSSi Foundation events are where the open source silicon community meets

FOSSi Foundation organizes several conferences and similar events every year
as a way to bring developers and users together to meet and share their work.

These events are of a varying size, but they all have in common that the focus
is on meeting others interested in free and open source silicon on a relaxed
atmosphere. Everyone is welcome to our events as is written in our
[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). We also try to make these events free
of charge to the extent possible as a way to lower the barrier of entry.

In addition to the events organized by FOSSI Foundation we also participate in
other events. Whenever there is an event around open source silicon, there's
a good chance someone from FOSSi Foundation will be there. And if we are there,
we are happy to talk to you.
