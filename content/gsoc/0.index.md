title: Google Summer of Code
---

The FOSSi Foundation regularly participates in [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) as an umbrella organization.
In this way we enable experienced community members to mentor mentees while the FOSSi Foundation takes care of the administrative parts of GSoC.

## Project ideas

Around January each year we ask our community members for project ideas they'd like to mentor.
These ideas are then collected and published.

* [GSoC 2026](/gsoc/gsoc26-ideas)
* [GSoC 2025](/gsoc/gsoc25-ideas)
* [GSoC 2024](/gsoc/gsoc24-ideas)
* [GSoC 2023](/gsoc/gsoc23-ideas)
* [GSoC 2022](/gsoc/gsoc22-ideas)
* [GSoC 2021](/gsoc/gsoc21-ideas)
* [GSoC 2020](/gsoc/gsoc20-ideas)
* [GSoC 2019](/gsoc/gsoc19-ideas)
* [GSoC 2018](/gsoc/gsoc18-ideas)
* [GSoC 2017](/gsoc/gsoc17-ideas)
* [GSoC 2016](/gsoc/gsoc16-ideas)

## FOSSi Foundation GSoC House Rules

The internet is full of material regarding GSoC, and most questions are answered somewhere already.
We especially recommend these documents:

* [GSoC guide for mentees](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student)
* [GSoC guide for mentors](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor)
* [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)

In addition we at the FOSSi Foundation have developed a couple of "house rules" which are outlined below.
We expect all mentees and mentors to adhere to them.

### Mentor availability

  <div class="base-1/3 my-auto mx-auto">
    <img src="/gsoc/images/2_mentors.png" class="block max-w-full h-auto"/>
  </div>
  <div class="base-1/3">
    <p>
    Each proposed project needs to have two mentors with at least
    2h per week available for the whole duration of the project.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="base-1/3 my-auto mx-auto">
    <img src="/gsoc/images/2_hours.png" class="block max-w-full h-auto"/>
  </div>
</div>

### Outreach

<div class="flex flex-col tablet:flex-row gap-24">
  <div class="basis-1/3 my-auto mx-auto">
    <img src="/gsoc/images/blogpost.png" class="block max-w-full h-auto"/>
  </div>
  <div class="basis-2/3">
<p>
    Students are expected to talk about their project publicly.
    At least one blog post (or video, or mailing list status update) per evaluation period, or ideally one a week.
    Blogs can be in the mentee's personal blog, the project blog, or guest posts on fossi-foundation.org.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="flex flex-col tablet:flex-row gap-24">
  <div class="basis-2/3">
    Mentors are expected to discuss help mentees write their blog posts, and check that they are provided in time.
    Not doing so is a reason to fail an evaluation!
  </div>
  <div class="basis-1/3 my-auto mx-auto">
    <img src="/gsoc/images/blogpost_mentors.png" class="block max-w-full h-auto"/>
  </div>
</div>

### Evaluations

<div class="flex flex-col tablet:flex-row gap-24">
  <div class="basis-1/3 my-auto mx-auto">
    <img src="/gsoc/images/eval.png" class="block max-w-full h-auto"/>
  </div>
  <div class="basis-2/3">
<p>
Students are required to complete evaluations on time, as per Google guidelines.
</p>

<p>
Mentors need to have mentee evaluations ready <b>at least</b> 48 hours before the deadlines in the GSoC timeline.
</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Communication

<div class="flex flex-col tablet:flex-row gap-24">
  <div class="basis-1/3 my-auto mx-auto">
    <img src="/gsoc/images/responsive.png" class="block max-w-full h-auto"/>
  </div>
  <div class="basis-2/3">
<p>Students need to be available for mentors in a timely manner, and let mentors know if they will be unavailable for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>Mentors need to respond to emails from the FOSSi Foundation GSoC org admins in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
  </div>
</div>



## Contact and Questions

If you are a mentee and have questions regarding the FOSSi Foundation GSoC projects, get in touch with the mentors listed on the project ideas page, or write an email to the private GSoC-specific mailing list [gsoc@fossi-foundation.org](mailto:gsoc@fossi-foundation.org).

If you have a specific question for the GSoC organizers at the FOSSi Foundation please speak to Jonathan, Olof, Philipp, or Stefan ([contact information](/about-us/core-team)).
