## The FOSSi Foundation in 110 words

> The FOSSi Foundation exists to promote and protect the open source silicon chip movement. It actively encourages the community’s growth and is helping to maintain the open spirit of the movement, through events, educational programmes and working groups. With an international membership of experts from academia and industry, it supports new open source initiatives and collaborations – offering free advice to governments and policy makers, corporations, academics and hobbyists. As a not-for profit organisation, the foundation is independent of any commercial interests and acts as a steward in support of open source projects which broadly benefit the open source silicon community. FOSSi is an acronym for Free and Open Source Silicon.
