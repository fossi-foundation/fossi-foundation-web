## Submit a talk

We encourage anybody involved in the open source semiconductor engineering space to come along and share your work or experience. Presentations slots as short as 3 minute lightning-talks and up to 30 minute talks including Q and A are available.

So if you've designed, worked on or even just used open source IP cores and/or management systems, verification IP, build flows, SoCs, simulators, synthesis tools, FPGA and ASIC implementation tools, languages and DSLs, compilers, or anything related we'd love to have you join us to share your experience.

Presentations are submitted through the registration process and we will let you know if your presentation was accepted.

## Registration

Will open soon.

## Sponsoring and volunteering at Latch-Up

Latch-Up is free to attend, but we aim to provide catering and the like during the event. Latch-Up is also a great way to get your company or brand in front of lots of engineers and hackers on the day, and thousands more through recordings of the event. So please [get in touch](mailto:latch-up@fossi-foundation.org) if you'd like to explore sponsorship opportunities.

Latch-Up is organized by volunteers on behalf of the FOSSi Foundation. We are currently looking for more people to help out with arrangements and putting on the event, so please do [email us](mailto:latch-up@fossi-foundation.org) if you would like to volunteer for during the event with setup, AV, or even just local knowledge so we can plan the weekend better.

## Venue

To be announced.
