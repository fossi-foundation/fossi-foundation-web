## Submit a talk

Presentation are submitted through :FfEventbriteLink{:eventId=eventbriteEventId text="the Eventbrite registration interface"}.

Please make your submissions as early as you can, as the presentation slots are likely to fill up quickly.

We aim to give as many people as possible the opportunity to present their exciting work on free and open source silicon.
To accomodate for that we will determine the duration of a full talk once all submissions are in.
Historically, full talks ran for 10 minutes (plus time for questions).
Lighning talks will be 3 minutes.
The exact amount of time you'll get will be communicated on acceptance of your talk.

## Code of conduct

We ask all Latch-Up participants to adhere to the the [FOSSi Foundation code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) throughout the event.

## Sponsors

Latch-Up is free to attend, but we aim to provide catering and the like during the event. Latch-Up is also a great way to get your company or brand in front of lots of engineers and hackers on the day, and thousands more through recordings of the event.

Please get in touch at [latch-up@fossi-foundation.org](mailto:latch-up@fossi-foundation.org?subject=Sponsorship) if you'd like to explore sponsorship opportunities.

A variety of sponsorship packages are available for this year's Latch-Up.
You'll find all of the details in our [sponsorship prospectus](latch-up_2025_sponsorship_prospectus.pdf).

Latch-Up is organized by volunteers on behalf of the FOSSi Foundation. We are currently looking for more people to help out with arrangements and putting on the event, so please do [email us](mailto:latch-up@fossi-foundation.org?subject=Volunteering) if you would like to volunteer for during the event with setup, AV, or even just local knowledge so we can plan the weekend better.

We plan to start on Friday morning at 9am and end the conference on Sunday afternoon.
When planning travel, we suggest you arrive Thursday evening or first thing Friday, and plan to leave Sunday afternoon or evening.

A conference social event will be arranged for Saturday evening.
Friday evening will not be planned but often folks arrange their own informal dinner and drinks plans, which we encourage.

The detailed schedule of presentations will be available once we have all of the presentation submissions.
All times are subject to change once we get closer to the event.

### Friday: Conference

Conference from 9am - 6pm.

### Saturday: Conference, lighning talks, and social event

Conference from 9am - 6pm.

### Sunday: Unconference and workshops

On Sunday we will have an unconference and workshops to have more time for focused discussions.
Even though the exact schedule and topics to talk about will be created together at the event, you can expect in-depth discussions with key stakeholders in Free and Open Source Silicon Projects, demo sessions, hackathrons, and more.

For exampe, at last year's ORConf we had fantastic sessions on
* cocotb
* EU Roadmap
* Amaranth
* Open Source DFT and in-field debug
* Clash and Haskell
* Surfer

What deep-dives will we have at Latch-Up?
It's up to all of us!
