  ## Submit a talk

  Presentations are submitted through :FfEventbriteLink{:eventId=eventbriteEventId text="the Eventbrite registration interface"}.

  Please make your submissions as early as you can, as the presentation slots are likely to fill up quickly.

  We aim to give as many people as possible the opportunity to present their exciting work on free and open source silicon.
  To accomodate for that we will determine the duration of a full talk once all submissions are in.
  Historically, full talks ran for 10 minutes (plus time for questions).
  Lighning talks will be 3 minutes.
  The exact amount of time you'll get will be communicated on acceptance of your talk.

  ## Code of conduct

  We ask all Latch-Up participants to adhere to the the [FOSSi Foundation code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) throughout the event.
