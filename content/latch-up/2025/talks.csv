,,Normal,"""One Student One Chip"" Initiative: Learn to Build RISC-V Chips from Scratch with MOOC",Xiaoke Su,Advocacy / Support of Free and Open Source Silicon,"The “One Student One Chip” (OSOC) initiative was launched by the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019. The initiative guides students through designing a RISC-V processor chip from scratch, including tape-out, developing a simple operating system, running it on the chip, running the real game Legend of Sword and Fairy, and completing the physical design process using open-source EDA tools. This enables students to understand the entire processor chip design process. As of February 2025, the total number of OSOC enrollments has exceeded 10,000. This report introduces the implementation of the “One Student One Chip” initiative and the outcomes of open-source chip talent cultivation.",,
,,Normal,Modeling digital signal processing to confirm frequency response and performance,David Hossack,Tools / Environment / SW for Free and Open Source Silicon,"A simple methodology for modelling digital signal processing was introduced at [ORConf 2024](https://fossi-foundation.org/orconf/2024#digital-signal-processing-modeling-with-julia). This has been greatly extended and now includes performance measurement (signal and band limited noise level, IMD, THD etc), fixed point arithmetic modeling, and frequency response determination - both directly at the transfer function level, and extracted from time domain simulation.",,

,,Normal,"BenchBot 2.0: Cleaner Code, Better Coverage, and Expanded Simulator Support",Adruth Vasudevan Srinivasan,Tools / Environment / SW for Free and Open Source Silicon,"BenchBot is an open-source Python tool that automates the creation of OSVVM-compliant testbenches for VHDL designs. It uses YAML configurations to define key parameters and generates a structured test environment. The generated testbenches include essential components such as clock and reset generators, stimulus handlers, and watchdog mechanisms. BenchBot also supports modular and distributed test development within the OSVVM framework.
This version builds on the previous generation developed in 2024. It introduces new features such as an enhanced functional coverage model for bit vectors and expanded simulator support. These improvements extend the capabilities of the generated VHDL testbenches, making them more versatile and comprehensive.
Additionally, the Python codebase has been completely refactored. The new implementation follows standard object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, improving code readability and maintainability. The structured design makes it easier to extend and adapt the tool for future enhancements.

In this talk, we will first discuss the complete refactoring of BenchBot’s Python codebase. The new implementation follows standard object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making the code more modular, readable, and maintainable. This structured design simplifies future enhancements and allows easier customization.
Next, we will highlight the new features added to the generated VHDL testbenches. These include an enhanced functional coverage model for bit vectors, improving verification completeness. Additionally, we will discuss how BenchBot now supports more simulators, including NVC, expanding its usability across different verification environments.

,,Normal,A Memory Design Language for Automated Memory Technology Mapping,Zachary Sisco,HW development for Free and Open Source Silicon,"During the chip development process, engineers need to target different technologies to support different deployment platforms, such as simulation, ASIC and FPGA technologies. Conventionally, they do this by splitting parts of the HDL (hardware description language) code into separate blocks for each technology (e.g., memories), implementing the same high-level behavior for each block but specialized for a given technology. This approach leads to a brittle code base, with multiple but subtly different technology-specific blocks of code describing the same semantic behavior, increasing the burden on verification, agility, and extensibility. The insight in this work is incorporating an abstract memory representation into the HDL which is ""write once, map anywhere"", meaning the memory representation has a rich enough semantics to target all of the relevant technologies using a single generic interface.

This DSL, called a memory design language, enables automated technology mapping for memories. Further, for designs coming from other HDLs which are already mapped to a specific technology, I also present a hardware decompilation-based memory inference technique which lifts memories from a gate-level design to an abstract memory block, enabling automated technology re-targeting, a holy grail for digital designers. The key mechanism of the approach is a unified set of algebraic rewrite rules based around memory block semantics. The technique leverages equality saturation to explore a large space of designs according to technology constraints, with the ability to elaborate ""forwards"" and ""backwards"". The memory design language targets five backends for three different technology platforms (simulation, ASIC, and FPGA). Further, decompilation-based memory inference outperforms the state of the art, demonstrating higher accuracy and enabling automated re-targeting.",,
,,Lighning Talk,Checking logic designs for CDC anti-patterns: cdc_snitch,Larry Doolittle,,"Almost all real-world logic designs (FPGA and ASIC) require use of multiple clock domains.  Techniques have been established to move information between clock domains (clock domain crossing, shortened to CDC).  It is easy, however, to lose track of where CDC happens in a large HDL code base, especially one that evolves as a collaborative effort. Our cdc_snitch tool leverages yosys' logic synthesis and transformation capabilities to analyze a design and find anti-patterns of CDC design.  This visibility has helped us improve our code quality, and is now a part of our continuous integration (CI) workflow.",,
,,Lighning Talk,fplib: A fixed point math library for SystemVerilog,Arman Samimi,,"[fplib](https://github.com/SkyworksSolutionsInc/fplib) is a synthesizable SystemVerilog library for working with fixed-point (FP) numbers. This library abstracts out the error-prone task of working with FP numbers, such as keeping track of the integer and fractional bits (the binary point) when doing add/multiply operations. fplib works by (ab)using SystemVerilog interfaces to encapsulate a normal logic vector as well as the parameters for the number of int/frac bits into a single object which can be passed through modules (in the absence of proper language support like in VHDL)",,
,,Normal,"SERV, QERV and HERV: Meet the family of the world's smallest RISC-V CPUs",Olof Kindgren,HW development for Free and Open Source Silicon,"The award-winning [SERV](https://github.com/olofk/serv) is the world's smallest RISC-V CPU and has already proven that you can get a real RISC-V for a fistful of gates. The trade-off is that it is slower than most other RISC-V cores, which is fine for most uses of SERV. But sometimes you need a little more performance and for those cases, we got just the thing for you.

Meet QERV, the quadrupled SERV! QERV is three times faster than SERV while only being approximately 20% larger, which means that it's still the world's smallest RISC-V CPU, only faster. Or why not try HERV, 5 times faster and 50% larger.

This presentation will look deeper into QERV and HERV, what makes them so small and how they compares to SERV when it comes to power efficiency, performance and area. We will also look at future features and optimizations in the pipeline and investigate what you can get for a few gates more.",,
,,Normal,Stronger Together: Europe Unites for Open-Source EDA,Stefan Wallentowitz,Advocacy / Support of Free and Open Source Silicon,"Europe is stepping up in Open Source Chip Design by funding various parts of the ecosystem.

This presentation gives a brief overview of how FOSSi Foundation played an integral role in this effort and how the community will benefit from, and which challenges are ahead.",,
,,Normal,bsg_pearls: Effortlessly Synthesizable Building Blocks That Work Right Out of the Shell,Dan Ruelas-Petrisko,HW development for Free and Open Source Silicon,"Accelerating agile hardware design requires aggressive reuse of libraries and methodologies. While libraries like Basejump STL, PULP Platform Common Cells and Chipyard excel at providing portability layers and low-level components (e.g. FIFOs, memories), and SoCs rely on hardened IP blocks for larger components (e.g. off-chip PHYs, processor cores), there remains a gap in reuseable blocks between these levels.

bsg_pearls bridges this gap by offering a library of mid-level synthesizable components - such as SDR links, DDR links, clock generators, LPDDR controllers - that can be seamlessly integrated into soft designs. Each submodule contains SystemVerilog design files, a synthesizable testbench, vendor-agnostic TCL constraints and technology-agnostic placement guidelines. By construction, pearls are highly runtime configurable and (mostly) decoupled from external timing paths, enabling early hardening in the design process. This drastically reduces full-chip iteration time while maintaining flexibility in immature RTL.

In this talk, I will present the philosophy and architecture of bsg_pearls; explore their use in real-world chip designs; discuss integration plans with open-source tooling; and invite feedback from the open-source hardware community to drive adoption!",,
,,Normal,Teaching Open Silicon Design in a Quarter: Using Cloud-based Open Agile EDA Platform,Yuchi Miao,Applications making use of Free and Open Source Silicon,"In this talk, we will introduce the open silicon education course by using open-source EDA toolchain (Yosys, cocotb, iEDA etc.) on IHP130 open PDK powered by cloud platform, with the primary objective to fill the gap between academic and industry. This course is currently under development and will be released in 2025Q2 with rich materials (lecture notes, slides, hands-on labs) and infrastructure support (RTL2GDS flow, LMS, cloud platform, etc.). Additionally, we will show a full practice on designing an education-oriented test chip (called “retroSoC”) to verify our new end-to-end workflow (Yosys+iEDA+IHP130) with cloud platform. Finally, we will further share more technical details on our EDA cloud platform and explore the performance boundaries by reimplementing some complicated SoCs on cloud platform. We hope this process can help us figure out performance bottleneck and promote the development of open EDA toolchain to make it suitable for various industry application scenario in the future.",,
,,Normal,svck: A Lightweight and Extensible SystemVerilog Linter,Himank Gangwal,Tools / Environment / SW for Free and Open Source Silicon,"svck is an open-source, minimalist linter designed to svck is an open-source, minimalist linter designed to enforce style and consistency rules for SystemVerilog code. It provides a Build Your Own Linter (BYOL) framework, allowing users to define custom linting rules while leveraging built-in checks for naming conventions, encapsulation, line spacing, and more. svck integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring maintainable and high-quality HDL code.

,,Normal,Breaking the Test Content Barrier with PSS,Matthew Ballance,Tools / Environment / SW for Free and Open Source Silicon,"Creating adequate test content to verify hardware designs across the IP to SoC process presents a a continual challenge for verification engineers. It certainly doesn't help that the unique goals, current verification languages, and restrictions of each verification platform make reuse of test content challenging and effort intensive.

Accellera Portable Stimulus Specification (PSS) language is a test-content modeling language that enables test content reuse from block IP to SoC and across simulation, hardware emulation, and silicon platforms. PSS provides zero-cost abstraction language features that model common verification scenarios, such as concurrency and resource contention, enabling compilation tools to create efficient platform-appropriate implementations.

This talk will provide an example-driven introduction to the PSS language, and provide resources and details of available open source tools that support learning about and using PSS.",,

This talk will go over the design of Hardcaml, providing general principles for designing new embedded DSLs for hardware design, and showcase how Hardcaml enables both high-level abstraction and low-level optimizations.",,
,,Normal,Fixed Point Numeric Types for Hardware Description,David Hossack,,"There are many existing libraries, both commercially licensed and free-and-open-source, for describing digital fixed-point arithmetic in hardware, but they all share some undesirable features.

A fixed point number is usually described by fixed information including the width of the binary number in bits, and their significance in a fixed point environment. For example, a 16 bit hardware value could represent numbers in the range 0..65536 notated as unsigned(16,0), or between -32768..32767 notated as signed(16,0), or as a number in the range -1..255/256 notated as signed(8,8) or as a number between -1..32767/32768 notated as signed(1,15), or many other options.  A key question is what is the result type when two 16 bit numbers in the same format are added? - in some cases a 16 bit result is expected (with modulo or overflowing behavior), but in many cases, a wider 17 bit result is wanted and expected.

Normal mathematical arithmetic is associative, where the ordering of addition is not important, but perhaps surprisingly, most fixed point library types are not.  Most existing fixed point libraries will overly widen the result type width when multiple additions are performed.  The value of using a fixed point library is severely diminished whenever the design engineer needs to override the widths that were determined automatically.

The parameterization used here is very simple as it treats signed and unsigned representations equivalently.  It neatly distinguishes between the cases where modulo overflow should be expected versus non-overflowing arithmetic with word length growth.  It can also distinguish between variables which require storage and constant fixed-point values which do not.  This is all achieved in a simple, mathematically pure manner.

Floating point types are not included, but the formulation has been used for describing hardware implementing floating point arithmetic and floating point function approximations.

This formulation is ideally suited for incorporation into future hardware description languages.",,
,,Normal,Overview of Static Timing Analysis in OpenSTA,Akash Levy,,"Static timing analysis (STA) is critical for ensuring that a chip will behave as expected post-tapeout.

,,Normal,The Sunburst Project phase 2 finale and its results,Hugo McNally,,"CHERI (Capability Enhanced RISC Instructions) is an extension to instruction set architectures that provides new primitives which can be used to enforce least privileged access to memory. This extension greatly reduces the risk of and reach of most security vulnerabilities. CHERIoT is CHERI designed for resource-constrained, embedded systems. Microsoft extended the lowRISC maintained Ibex Core with CHERIoT and created an RTOS that fully utilises CHERIoT.

The Sunburst Project is a, UKRI/DSbD funded, lowRISC project with the goal of helping CHERIoT technologies traverse the gap from academia to industry. After one and a half years, phases 1 & 2 of the project are all wrapped up having surpassed its original objectives. The two most consequential FOSS outputs are the Sonata™ development platform and the recently announced Sunburst chip repository. The Sonata™ platform is the combination of a full developer tool-chain and an FPGA evaluation board for experimenting with CHERIoT. Sunburst chip leverages open source hardware IP blocks from the open source OpenTitan Project that have received industry level verification into an open SoC design with a full design verification environment and a formally verified CHERIoT enabled RISC-V core. SCI Semiconductor is using the Sunburst chip as the foundation of their new ICENI microcontroller which will have its first tape-out later this year.

The Sunburst / CHERIoT Hardware Enablement Project has been funded by DSbD / UKRI - Grant Number: 107540",,
,,Normal,Better FPGA Technology Mapping with Lakeroad,Gus Henry Smith,,"Existing state-of-the-art technology mappers struggle to map designs to complex, programmable FPGA primitives such as DSPs.
