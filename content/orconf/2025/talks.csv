Fri,10:30,Normal,Unified and Open Evaluation of LLMs for RTL Generation,Dario Garcia Gasulla,"At the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) we are actively pushing research on LLMs for chip design. Our early contributions include an integrated evaluation framework (TuRTLe) to assess RTL code quality under syntax, functionality, synthesizability and PPA performance. Commited to open science, this is done in integration with open tools (Icarus, Yosis, OpenROAD), and publicly released for others to use and extend. This talk will include insights on the latest model performance, evaluation challenges and future research lines of work, towards improving the use of LLMs for EDA.",,

Fri,11:15,Normal,B-ASIC - a Python framework for manual and automated design and implementation of static algorithms,Simon Bjurek,"B-ASIC is a work-in-progress open source framework for the design and implementation of static algorithms. Expressing an algorithm using a block diagram/signal flow graph, the algorithm can be simulated, including finite wordlengths. From that, the algorithm is mapped to hardware, by first scheduling the algorithm, extracting and mapping resources, resulting in an architecture. This can be done either manually, automatic or by a suitable combination, using the exact operations/processing elements that the designer finds suitable. A bit like high-level synthesis, but with more control of the steps. Finally, code describing major parts of the architecture can be generated.",,
Fri,11:30,Normal,Simulating finite wordlength effects in Python with APyTypes,Mikael Henriksson,"[APyTypes](https://apytypes.github.io/apytypes/) is a open source Python library, similar to NumPy, that provides fully parametrizable bit-exact scalar and array data types with either fixed-point or floating-point representation. This allows performing high-level simulations of finite word-length effect before implementing an algorithm. Implemented in C++, the library has significantly higher performance and/or are more complete than the alternatives. In this talk, APyTypes is introduced and it is shown how algorithms can be simulated and the results used for checking the implementation.",,

Fri,12:00,Normal,Building a public FuseSoC package pool,Olof Kindgren,"The award-winning FuseSoC is now almost 15 years old and has become the most popular package manager for IP cores. There are today thousands of FuseSoC-compatible created and used by the industry, academia and hobbyists. One problem, however, has remained - where to find the IP cores.

To remedy this we have just introduced a project to build a public central database where users can browse and access IP cores, together with an easy way for users to make their own cores easily available for others.

This project proposes to create server-side infrastructure for a public collection of FuseSoC-compatible IP cores, a web interface to browse and inspect cores and expand FuseSoC to with code for users to easily publish their cores to this collection.

To improve trust in the system, and to help with CRA compliance, this project will also add support for signing packages, support for describing SPDX compliance and for applying tags to the project to indicate e.g. whether the project has been formally verified, silicon proven, is affected by any CVE, certifications etc.",,
Fri,12:15,Normal,Guix for FPGAs,Cayetano Santos,"A new approach in digital electronics design for FPGAs has recently arisen, featuring advanced packaging, versioning and dependency management capabilities for gateware HDL design. Strongly based on Guix dependency manager, this approach departs from traditional methods and opens the door to a fully declarative paradigm on dependency handling, including transactions and determinism, which guarantees traceability during the full design cycle. It is thus possible to treat IP Blocks as any other project requirement -including software-, in addition to producing fully reproducible environments and container images, facilitating the path towards modern continuous integration practices. User custom dedicated repositories allow the development of all that's necessary to build (hdlmake), simulate (ghdl), synthesize (yosys) and implement (nextpnr) designs remotely, using unit testing frameworks (vunit) and modern verification libraries (osvvm), in addition to performing cosimulation (cocotb) in remote forges.",,

Fri,14:45,Normal,Constrainedrandom - a Python package that does what it says on the tin,William Keen,"Constrainedrandom is a Python package for - you guessed it - creating and solving constrained randomization problems. It's faster than PyVSC. It achieves this by walking the through state space randomly, rather than using exhaustive solutions for constraints. That makes it much faster for the majority case, though it's possible for it not to converge for harder problems.",,

Fri,17:15,Normal,Dyno-SV: A new IR-driven open-source RTL synthesis tool,Mathis Salmen,"Dyno-SV is a new open-source RTL synthesis tool. It is not based on either Yosys or MLIR, but Dyno-IR, a new generic IR for hardware and more. Dyno-IR enables representation of designs at every level of abstraction from behavioral to gate level, with sufficient performance for transformations, even at lower levels.

The tool is built around a middle end optimizer operating at the process/control flow level of abstraction. Only late is control flow fully discarded and code converted to netlist level. This approach allows using the middle end for both synthesis and simulation and simplifies a number of transformations.

The tool is in active development, already achieving end-to-end synthesis using Slang as a frontend and ABC as a combinatorial logic backend. We plan to further refine its capabilities as an extensible platform for hardware synthesis and simulation.",,

Fri,17:45,Normal,najaeada - Getting closer to an industrial grade ECO solution with an open source stack,Noam Cohen,"[najaeda](https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/) is a Python library that encapsulates [naja](https://github.com/najaeda/naja), an advanced C++ open source framework for post synthesis netlist browsing and optimization. 
One of the prominent uses for najaeda by the community has been ECOs due to its ease of use, friendly API and installation. 
Licensed tools for ECOs can be costly and sometimes not dynamic enough. This results in a large number of engineers resorting to manual changes that can be time consuming and inconvenient. najaeda presents a reliable and straight forward open source alternative. 
In this talk we will do an overview of the library’s capabilities and our plan to integrate embedded verification infrastructure in order to meet industrial standards and provide the community with a fully open source alternative.",,

Sat,9:45,Normal,"Extending RISC-V with SCAIE-V: Portable, Efficient, and Scalable Custom Instruction Integration",Tammo Mürmann,"Systems that require low power consumption or high performance often employ in-hardware accelerators to meet these demands. While complex algorithms can be efficiently offloaded to memory-mapped accelerators, small computational kernels are typically unsuitable due to overhead and latency. For these cases, custom instructions provide a more efficient acceleration path. However, custom instructions introduce new challenges, including the need for tight integration into the processor pipeline, which can reduce portability.

Although tools for Instruction Set Architecture Extension (ISAX) integration exist, many are commercial, limited to specific core families (e.g., RoCC), support only a subset of instruction types (e.g., no memory access in CV-X-IF), or are still work-in-progress (e.g. RISC-V CX).

SCAIE-V overcomes these limitations by providing a flexible and efficient interface that integrates directly into the processor pipeline.
Its logic generation framework supports portability across cores, simultaneous integration of multiple ISAXes, arbitrary instruction encodings, and stateful instruction behavior.

To support a wide range of use cases, SCAIE-V offers three instruction execution modes:


1) Tightly-coupled instructions execute in lockstep with the processor pipeline.
2) Semi-coupled instructions also execute in lockstep but may span multiple internal stages per pipeline stage, enabling more complex computations.
3) Decoupled instructions execute independently and may write back at any time, with hazards automatically managed by SCAIE-V.


In addition, SCAIE-V supports instruction-independent behavior, enabling operations that are decoupled from specific instruction execution, like zero-overhead loops.

SCAIE-V is compatible with several well-known RISC-V cores of varying complexity, such as PicoRV32, VexRiscv, CVA5, and CVA6. Implementation in a modern 22nm ASIC process demonstrates minimal overhead and significant performance gains.",,
Sat,10:00,Normal,Wildcat: Educational RISC-V Microprocessors,Martin Schoeberl,"In computer architecture courses, we usually teach RISC processors using a five-stage pipeline, neglecting alternative organizations. This design choice, rooted in 1980s technology, may not be optimal today, and it is certainly not the easiest pipeline for education. This talk examines more straightforward pipeline organizations for RISC processors suitable for educational purposes and for implementing embedded processors in FPGAs and ASICs. We analyze resource costs and maximum clock frequency of various designs implemented in an FPGA, using clock frequency as a performance proxy. Additionally, we validate these results with ASIC designs synthesized using the open-source SkyWater130 process.
 
Contradictory to common wisdom, a longer pipeline (up to 5 stages) does not necessarily always increase the maximum clock frequency. In [two FPGA and one ASIC implementation](https://github.com/schoeberl/wildcat), we discovered that a four- or five-stage pipeline leads to a slower clock frequency than a three-stage implementation. The reason is that the width of the forwarding multiplexer in the execution stage increases with longer pipelines, which is on the critical path. We also argue that a 3-stage pipeline organization is more adequate for teaching a pipeline organization of a microprocessor.",,
Sat,10:15,Normal,SpiceBind: Integrating SPICE-Level Analog Models into RTL verification,Tomasz Hemperek,"Open-source digital verification has advanced rapidly, but mixed-signal designs still lack a seamless path into modern RTL testbenches. This talk surveys today's community-driven options, pinpointing their remaining pain points.

I then introduce [SpiceBind](https://github.com/themperek/spicebind), a lightweight VPI bridge that embeds an ngspice solver inside any VPI-capable simulator. RTL and SPICE devices step on the same timestep, while your existing testbench, coverage, and waveform tools remain unchanged.

A top-level case study demonstrates how SpiceBind drops into a typical RTL simulation, and runs unmodified in a CI workflow. 

Attendees will leave with an entirely open-source, reproducible recipe for bringing mixed-signal verification into their designed.",,

Luckily we (e.g. ChipFlow) is developing one for IHP and their SG13G2 open source process. This work is done in the FlowSpace project funded by the German government. In this project, the Arrakeen python framework - presented at last years ORConf - is used so the resulting compiler will also be easily portable to other technologies. Porting to Sky130 and GF180MCU is in the planning. In the FlowSpace project, next to the compiler itself, extensions will be developed to radiation harden the resulting blocks.

Sat,14:00,Normal,"Mission-Specific Chips for Space: Open Tools, Real Systems, Radical Performance",Thomas Parry,"Space electronics operate in an environment that demands the highest levels of reliability, radiation tolerance, and performance - under some of the harshest constraints on Size, Weight & Power (SWaP). Yet system designers are consistently faced with a painful choice: use off-the-shelf terrestrial chips that aren’t built for the mission, or rely on space-rated parts that are expensive, obsolete, and lacking performance.

At SPHERICAL, we’re solving this problem by collapsing the gap between chips and systems. We build high-reliability, high-performance space systems by designing our own mission-specific chips - enabled by open-source tools and a modern, software-first methodology. This approach lets us deliver systems that are not only more capable but radically more flexible, auditable, and scalable.

Any potential attacks from insiders or outsiders need to be taken into account. If properly addressed, the approach will allow confidential communication, secure boot, code-signing, etc.
The presentation will furthermore introduce two new documents concerning plans for action, namely:
2. High-level specifications about how to design a Caliptra-like security module, with an emphasis on open components without vulnerabilities. The specification is planned to be made available ahead of the conference. It contains information about our plans to design an open, hardware-based random number generator. Furthermore, an extension to the IHP-Open130-G2 PDK will be provided, i.e. root of trust elements as a proprietary, certifiable module, usable for industrial adoption, with free access to academia. We encourage industry to express interest in our approach, experts to comment, and media to report about the planned open security module design. 
3. Furthermore, a Working Paper will be presented describing paths for open- source hardware.

It addresses some important limitations of existing FFI methodologies for the current generation of AMD devices, such as the coarse granularity of FI experiments and the lack of support for ASIC fault models. Like most modern FFI tools, BAFFI relies on the partial runtime reconfiguration (RTR) technique to emulate hardware faults. Additionally, BAFFI maps the configuration memory (CM) bits with the hierarchical design netlist for the main types of logic cells. This mapping enables targeting any selected component in the design tree for fault injection, either individual look-up tables (LUT) or registers, which provides finer-grain analysis capabilities than alternative tools and eliminates the need for area constraints. At the same time, BAFFI extends the set of fault models beyond the commonly considered single event upsets (SEU) in CM, to support the emulation of transient ASIC faults in the storage cells by orchestrating the manipulation of multiple associated CM bits. This talk provides further details on the architecture and capabilities of BAFFI and exemplifies its application to an open-source RISC-V SoC (NOELV) prototyped on an AMD Virtex Ultrascale+ FPGA.",,
