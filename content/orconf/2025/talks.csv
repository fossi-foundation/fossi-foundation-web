,,Break,Opening,FOSSi Foundation team,,,,
,,Normal,Guix for FPGAs,Cayetano Santos,,"A new approach in digital electronics design for FPGAs has recently arisen, featuring advanced packaging, versioning and dependency management capabilities for gateware HDL design. Strongly based on Guix dependency manager, this approach departs from traditional methods and opens the door to a fully declarative paradigm on dependency handling, including transactions and determinism, which guarantees traceability during the full design cycle. It is thus possible to treat IP Blocks as any other project requirement -including software-, in addition to producing fully reproducible environments and container images, facilitating the path towards modern continuous integration practices. User custom dedicated repositories allow the development of all that's necessary to build (hdlmake), simulate (ghdl), and synthesize (yosys) designs remotely, using unit testing frameworks (vunit) and modern verification libraries (osvvm), in addition to performing cosimulation (cocotb) in remote forges.",,
,,Normal,"GDSFactory: Open-Source EDA for Accelerating Photonics, Quantum, MEMS, and RF Chip Design",Joaquin Matres,,"The design of advanced chips‚ especially in photonics, quantum, MEMS, and RF, faces critical challenges due to rigid, outdated EDA tools. Many teams resort to custom Python, C, or MATLAB solutions, which offer flexibility but lack scalability. To bridge this gap, we created GDSFactory, an open-source, python-based Analog Electronic Design Automation software that has been downloaded over 2 million times and adopted by companies, universities, and research organizations worldwide.",,
,,Normal,"Tiliqua - Accessible, Reconfigurable Audio DSP Platform",Sebastian Holzapfel,,"[Tiliqua](https://github.com/apfelaudio/tiliqua) is an open hardware development platform, DSP library and collection of examples (built in Amaranth HDL) that aims to make FPGA-based audio and video synthesis more accessible. This talk builds on [last year's edition](https://fossi-foundation.org/orconf/2024#synthesizing-music-synthesizers), this time covering some war stories from the past 12 months of getting Tiliqua hardware ready to ship, and all the new features added to the DSP/RTL library since then. We'll cover some fun topics such:

* Implementing low-latency USB host purely in gateware
* Dynamic frequency scaling for display switching
* New DSP cores and example projects
* How we are adding first-class fixed-point types to the Amaranth language
* Lessons learned from shipping hardware (and some tricks for passing CE/EMC)

 As we walk through each theme, this talk will include some live demos on a small Eurorack system demonstrating each.",,
,,Normal,Panamax FPGA - An Open Source FPGA on SKY130,Leo Moser,,"A FABulous FPGA utilizing the Panamax padframe designed using open source EDA tools and the open source sky130 PDK.

,,Normal,Constrainedrandom - a Python package that does what it says on the tin,William Keen,,"Constrainedrandom is a Python package for - you guessed it - creating and solving constrained randomization problems. It's faster than PyVSC. It achieves this by walking the through state space randomly, rather than using exhaustive solutions for constraints. That makes it much faster for the majority case, though it's possible for it not to converge for harder problems.",,
,,Normal,Transactron - hardware transactions for Amaranth HDL,Aria Węgrzyn,,"Overview of our open-source [Transactron library](https://github.com/kuznia-rdzeni/transactron) for Amaranth HDL language, how it makes designing complex hardware easier, modular, solid and fun, introduction to the concept and demos.",,
,,Normal,LibreLane: Looking to the future,Mohamed (Donn) Gaber,,"Designed to overcome the limitations of OpenLane but maintain its signature ease-of-configuration and ease-of-installation, LibreLane is the modular and extensible community-driven successor to the world's most popular open source EDA flow, reimagining it as not just a flow, but as a customizable ASIC data flow infrastructure. In this talk, we will outline what motivated us to make LibreLane, what it's currently capable of, and our future development plans, as well as a showcase of both simple and advanced use-cases it enables.",,
,,Normal,Wildcat: Educational RISC-V Microprocessors,Martin Schoeberl,,"In computer architecture courses, we usually teach RISC processors using a five-stage pipeline, neglecting alternative organizations. This design choice, rooted in 1980s technology, may not be optimal today, and it is certainly not the easiest pipeline for education. This talk examines more straightforward pipeline organizations for RISC processors suitable for educational purposes and for implementing embedded processors in FPGAs and ASICs. We analyze resource costs and maximum clock frequency of various designs implemented in an FPGA, using clock frequency as a performance proxy. Additionally, we validate these results with ASIC designs synthesized using the open-source SkyWater130 process.
 
Contradictory to common wisdom, a longer pipeline (up to 5 stages) does not necessarily always increase the maximum clock frequency. In [two FPGA and one ASIC implementation](https://github.com/schoeberl/wildcat), we discovered that a four- or five-stage pipeline leads to a slower clock frequency than a three-stage implementation. The reason is that the width of the forwarding multiplexer in the execution stage increases with longer pipelines, which is on the critical path. We also argue that a 3-stage pipeline organization is more adequate for teaching a pipeline organization of a microprocessor.",,
,,Normal,SpiceBind: Integrating SPICE-Level Analog Models into RTL verification,Tomasz Hemperek,,"Open-source digital verification has advanced rapidly, but mixed-signal designs still lack a seamless path into modern RTL testbenches. This talk surveys today's community-driven options, pinpointing their remaining pain points.

I then introduce [SpiceBind](https://github.com/themperek/spicebind), a lightweight VPI bridge that embeds an ngspice solver inside any VPI-capable simulator. RTL and SPICE devices step on the same timestep, while your existing testbench, coverage, and waveform tools remain unchanged.

A top-level case study demonstrates how SpiceBind drops into a typical RTL simulation, and runs unmodified in a CI workflow. 

Attendees will leave with an entirely open-source, reproducible recipe for bringing mixed-signal verification into their designed.",,
,,Normal,Open-Source FPGA Test Visualization for cocotb,Grant Bowers,,"Junit outputs from cocotb are a useful building block for maintaining Continuous Integration (CI) for silicon projects. This can be extended through the use of OpenMetrics and Grafana to provide dashboards to present useful metrics and insights such as test coverage over time, simulator usage or bug tracking.",,

,,Normal,najaeada - Getting closer to an industrial grade ECO solution with an open source stack,Noam Cohen,,"[najaeda](https://pypi.org/project/najaeda/) is a Python library that encapsulates [naja](https://github.com/najaeda/naja), an advanced C++ open source framework for post synthesis netlist browsing and optimization. 
One of the prominent uses for najaeda by the community has been ECOs due to its ease of use, friendly API and installation. 
Licensed tools for ECOs can be costly and sometimes not dynamic enough. This results in a large number of engineers resorting to manual changes that can be time consuming and inconvenient. najaeda presents a reliable and straight forward open source alternative.

,,Normal,"Mission-Specific Chips for Space: Open Tools, Real Systems, Radical Performance",Thomas Parry,,"Space electronics operate in an environment that demands the highest levels of reliability, radiation tolerance, and performance - under some of the harshest constraints on Size, Weight & Power (SWaP). Yet system designers are consistently faced with a painful choice: use off-the-shelf terrestrial chips that aren’t built for the mission, or rely on space-rated parts that are expensive, obsolete, and lacking performance.

At SPHERICAL, we’re solving this problem by collapsing the gap between chips and systems. We build high-reliability, high-performance space systems by designing our own mission-specific chips - enabled by open-source tools and a modern, software-first methodology. This approach lets us deliver systems that are not only more capable but radically more flexible, auditable, and scalable.

This talk will walk through our design philosophy, the tool flows we’ve developed and adapted, and how we’re leveraging the open-source silicon ecosystem to deliver 10x improvements in performance, reliability, and configurability. We’ll close by reflecting on the opportunities and missing pieces for the open-source community to power the next generation of critical systems.",,
,,Normal,B-ASIC - a Python framework for manual and automated design and implementation of static algorithms,Simon Bjurek,,"B-ASIC is a work-in-progress open source framework for the design and implementation of static algorithms. Expressing an algorithm using a block diagram/signal flow graph, the algorithm can be simulated, including finite wordlengths. From that, the algorithm is mapped to hardware, by first scheduling the algorithm, extracting and mapping resources, resulting in an architecture. This can be done either manually, automatic or by a suitable combination, using the exact operations/processing elements that the designer finds suitable. A bit like high-level synthesis, but with more control of the steps. Finally, code describing major parts of the architecture can be generated.",,

,,Lightning Talk,osNoC: Open-Source Network-on-Chip,José Manuel Rocher González,,"This talk describes the effort carried out to make our in-house Network-on-chip available to a wider commutity. To that end, the Network Interface (NI) was redesigned to support a broader range of communication protocols, including AXI-MM and AXI Stream. This effort targets a significant gap in open-source NoC architectures, where standard-compliant, reusable IP blocks are rarely available. By contributing these components as open-source, the project aims to improve accessibility and foster wider adoption and collaboration in the hardware research community.",,
,,Lightning Talk,BAFFI: a bit-accurate fault injection tool for dependability assessment of FPGA prototypes,Ilya Tuzov,,"BAFFI is an open-source FPGA fault injection (FFI) tool that automates dependability assessment of FPGA prototypes. It addresses some important limitations of existing FFI methodologies for the current generation of AMD devices, such as the coarse granularity of FI experiments and the lack of support for ASIC fault models. Like most modern FFI tools, BAFFI relies on the partial runtime reconfiguration (RTR) technique to emulate hardware faults. Additionally, BAFFI maps the configuration memory (CM) bits with the hierarchical design netlist for the main types of logic cells. This mapping enables targeting any selected component in the design tree for fault injection, either individual look-up tables (LUT) or registers, which provides finer-grain analysis capabilities than alternative tools and eliminates the need for area constraints. At the same time, BAFFI extends the set of fault models beyond the commonly considered single event upsets (SEU) in CM, to support the emulation of transient ASIC faults in the storage cells by orchestrating the manipulation of multiple associated CM bits. This talk provides further details on the architecture and capabilities of BAFFI and exemplifies its application to an open-source RISC-V SoC (NOELV) prototyped on an AMD Virtex Ultrascale+ FPGA.",,
