Expressing an algorithm using a block diagram/signal flow graph, the algorithm can be simulated, including finite wordlengths. From that, the algorithm is mapped to hardware, by first scheduling the algorithm, extracting and mapping resources, resulting in an architecture. This can be done either manually, automatic or by a suitable combination, using the exact operations/processing elements that the designer finds suitable. A bit like high-level synthesis, but with more control of the steps. Finally, code describing major parts of the architecture can be generated.",https://youtu.be/bwGKCrFbMtc,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XnVxX5htrivjC1S6bPPcJYJ2i6aPNpGR/view?usp=sharing

There are today thousands of FuseSoC-compatible created and used by the industry, academia and hobbyists. One problem, however, has remained - where to find the IP cores.

To remedy this we have just introduced a project to build a public central database where users can browse and access IP cores, together with an easy way for users to make their own cores easily available for others.

This project proposes to create server-side infrastructure for a public collection of FuseSoC-compatible IP cores, a web interface to browse and inspect cores and expand FuseSoC to with code for users to easily publish their cores to this collection.

To improve trust in the system, and to help with CRA compliance, this project will also add support for signing packages, support for describing SPDX compliance and for applying tags to the project to indicate e.g. whether the project has been formally verified, silicon proven, is affected by any CVE, certifications etc.",https://youtu.be/mjANnJ1rwVk,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PcxhwYNXzIIQzVOuwrAaU9hAxX8KWG4y/view?usp=sharing

Strongly based on Guix dependency manager, this approach departs from traditional methods and opens the door to a fully declarative paradigm on dependency handling, including transactions and determinism, which guarantees traceability during the full design cycle. It is thus possible to treat IP Blocks as any other project requirement -including software-, in addition to producing fully reproducible environments and container images, facilitating the path towards modern continuous integration practices.

It is not based on either Yosys or MLIR, but Dyno-IR, a new generic IR for hardware and more. Dyno-IR enables representation of designs at every level of abstraction from behavioral to gate level, with sufficient performance for transformations, even at lower levels.

The tool is built around a middle end optimizer operating at the process/control flow level of abstraction. Only late is control flow fully discarded and code converted to netlist level. This approach allows using the middle end for both synthesis and simulation and simplifies a number of transformations.

The tool is in active development, already achieving end-to-end synthesis using Slang as a frontend and ABC as a combinatorial logic backend. We plan to further refine its capabilities as an extensible platform for hardware synthesis and simulation.",https://youtu.be/H-sggJKpQWE,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XbqxPSfbccfaH-k8o_NgQds3Pw8cusqa/view?usp=sharing

One of the prominent uses for najaeda by the community has been ECOs due to its ease of use, friendly API and installation. 
Licensed tools for ECOs can be costly and sometimes not dynamic enough. This results in a large number of engineers resorting to manual changes that can be time consuming and inconvenient. najaeda presents a reliable and straight forward open source alternative.

Sat,9:45,Normal,"Extending RISC-V with SCAIE-V: Portable, Efficient, and Scalable Custom Instruction Integration",Tammo Mürmann,"Systems that require low power consumption or high performance often employ in-hardware accelerators to meet these demands. While complex algorithms can be efficiently offloaded to memory-mapped accelerators, small computational kernels are typically unsuitable due to overhead and latency. For these cases, custom instructions provide a more efficient acceleration path. However, custom instructions introduce new challenges, including the need for tight integration into the processor pipeline, which can reduce portability.

Although tools for Instruction Set Architecture Extension (ISAX) integration exist, many are commercial, limited to specific core families (e.g., RoCC), support only a subset of instruction types (e.g., no memory access in CV-X-IF), or are still work-in-progress (e.g. RISC-V CX).

SCAIE-V overcomes these limitations by providing a flexible and efficient interface that integrates directly into the processor pipeline.
Its logic generation framework supports portability across cores, simultaneous integration of multiple ISAXes, arbitrary instruction encodings, and stateful instruction behavior.

To support a wide range of use cases, SCAIE-V offers three instruction execution modes:


1) Tightly-coupled instructions execute in lockstep with the processor pipeline.
2) Semi-coupled instructions also execute in lockstep but may span multiple internal stages per pipeline stage, enabling more complex computations.
3) Decoupled instructions execute independently and may write back at any time, with hazards automatically managed by SCAIE-V.


In addition, SCAIE-V supports instruction-independent behavior, enabling operations that are decoupled from specific instruction execution, like zero-overhead loops.

SCAIE-V is compatible with several well-known RISC-V cores of varying complexity, such as PicoRV32, VexRiscv, CVA5, and CVA6. Implementation in a modern 22nm ASIC process demonstrates minimal overhead and significant performance gains.",https://youtu.be/YRl0T0DQhd4,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tfltt9ow5L8NIqBMOAYydXG5LSs7BkUC/view?usp=sharing
Sat,10:00,Normal,Wildcat: Educational RISC-V Microprocessors,Martin Schoeberl,"In computer architecture courses, we usually teach RISC processors using a five-stage pipeline, neglecting alternative organizations. This design choice, rooted in 1980s technology, may not be optimal today, and it is certainly not the easiest pipeline for education. This talk examines more straightforward pipeline organizations for RISC processors suitable for educational purposes and for implementing embedded processors in FPGAs and ASICs. We analyze resource costs and maximum clock frequency of various designs implemented in an FPGA, using clock frequency as a performance proxy. Additionally, we validate these results with ASIC designs synthesized using the open-source SkyWater130 process.
 
Contradictory to common wisdom, a longer pipeline (up to 5 stages) does not necessarily always increase the maximum clock frequency. In [two FPGA and one ASIC implementation](https://github.com/schoeberl/wildcat), we discovered that a four- or five-stage pipeline leads to a slower clock frequency than a three-stage implementation. The reason is that the width of the forwarding multiplexer in the execution stage increases with longer pipelines, which is on the critical path. We also argue that a 3-stage pipeline organization is more adequate for teaching a pipeline organization of a microprocessor.",https://youtu.be/nmtyEEVvkHw,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paQ7XnCHDI2jsdU00LFtvd2O_31N0SZA/view?usp=sharing

Yet system designers are consistently faced with a painful choice: use off-the-shelf terrestrial chips that aren’t built for the mission, or rely on space-rated parts that are expensive, obsolete, and lacking performance.

At SPHERICAL, we’re solving this problem by collapsing the gap between chips and systems. We build high-reliability, high-performance space systems by designing our own mission-specific chips - enabled by open-source tools and a modern, software-first methodology.

Following their first successful trial runs in early 2025, participant feedback has been largely integrated into the course content. All materials are openly licensed and made publicly available via Git repositories.
The session will provide insights into the structure, motivation, and early outcomes of these initiatives, demonstrating how open-source tools and methodologies are being used to foster semiconductor education in Germany and beyond. This work is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) as part of the DI-OCDCpro project (Funding Code: 16ME0940) and the FMD-QNC project (Funding Code: 16ME0831).",https://youtu.be/n-wnvB0LiFE,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lW54YeaSAIrZ2bZjFb5GSIi3_QI-w2Vv/view?usp=sharing

,,Lightning Talk,Closing Gaps in Open Secure Hardware Value Chains,"A. Weber, N. Herfurth, S. Andreev","This presentation will address: 
1. Motivations regarding security within the German research projects HEP and Sign-HEP. These projects are about creating open security modules with an open tool chain and PDK. Any potential attacks from insiders or outsiders need to be taken into account. If properly addressed, the approach will allow confidential communication, secure boot, code-signing, etc.
The presentation will furthermore introduce two new documents concerning plans for action, namely:
2. High-level specifications about how to design a Caliptra-like security module, with an emphasis on open components without vulnerabilities. The specification is planned to be made available ahead of the conference. It contains information about our plans to design an open, hardware-based random number generator. Furthermore, an extension to the IHP-Open130-G2 PDK will be provided, i.e. root of trust elements as a proprietary, certifiable module, usable for industrial adoption, with free access to academia. We encourage industry to express interest in our approach, experts to comment, and media to report about the planned open security module design. 
3. Furthermore, a Working Paper will be presented describing paths for open- source hardware. The paper addresses issues such as a) already emerging products, b) easing innovation, c) issues of global co-ordination and 4) paths towards more efficient, more open and more secure fabs. The paper is already available at https://hep-alliance.org/Project/.",,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sio_5NHW3BMoC4c8SFfc_3bj2FrjZkAz/view?usp=drive_link
,,Lightning Talk,osNoC: Open-Source Network-on-Chip,José Manuel Rocher González,"This talk describes the effort carried out to make our in-house Network-on-chip available to a wider commutity. To that end, the Network Interface (NI) was redesigned to support a broader range of communication protocols, including AXI-MM and AXI Stream. This effort targets a significant gap in open-source NoC architectures, where standard-compliant, reusable IP blocks are rarely available.

,,Lightning Talk,BAFFI: a bit-accurate fault injection tool for dependability assessment of FPGA prototypes,Ilya Tuzov,"BAFFI is an open-source FPGA fault injection (FFI) tool that automates dependability assessment of FPGA prototypes. It addresses some important limitations of existing FFI methodologies for the current generation of AMD devices, such as the coarse granularity of FI experiments and the lack of support for ASIC fault models. Like most modern FFI tools, BAFFI relies on the partial runtime reconfiguration (RTR) technique to emulate hardware faults. Additionally, BAFFI maps the configuration memory (CM) bits with the hierarchical design netlist for the main types of logic cells. This mapping enables targeting any selected component in the design tree for fault injection, either individual look-up tables (LUT) or registers, which provides finer-grain analysis capabilities than alternative tools and eliminates the need for area constraints. At the same time, BAFFI extends the set of fault models beyond the commonly considered single event upsets (SEU) in CM, to support the emulation of transient ASIC faults in the storage cells by orchestrating the manipulation of multiple associated CM bits. This talk provides further details on the architecture and capabilities of BAFFI and exemplifies its application to an open-source RISC-V SoC (NOELV) prototyped on an AMD Virtex Ultrascale+ FPGA.",,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qlIppgiqxL54rH9RyzCSKKok4WhuZQrz/view?usp=drive_link
