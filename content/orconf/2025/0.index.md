### Sunday, Sept 14: Unconference and workshops

On Sunday we will have an unconference and workshops to have more time for focused discussions.
Even though the exact schedule and topics to talk about will be created together at the event, you can expect in-depth discussions with key stakeholders in Free and Open Source Silicon Projects, demo sessions, hackathons, and more.

**Community Building for Publicly Funded Projects**

Many open source projects originated from an academic or industrial research environment. Over the last years we see an increasing interest from funding agencies in open source EDA tools, open source design IP and open PDKs. One of the challenges of such projects is to build sustainable communities around the project results.

In this workshop we want to discuss experiences from publicly funded projects and jointly formulate goals and guidelines that can be useful.

Contact: [Stefan Wallentowitz](mailto:stefan@fossi-foundation.org)

**Discussion topics proposed**

* Timing closure challenges on your open-source projects (Matthew Guthaus)

**Ideas for other unconference and workshops?**

For exampe, at last year's ORConf we had fantastic sessions on
* cocotb
* EU Roadmap
* Amaranth
* Open Source DFT and in-field debug
* Clash and Haskell
* Surfer

What deep-dives will we have at ORConf?
It's up to all of us!

Feel free to submit your ideas ahead of ORConf or propose them throughout the conference.
