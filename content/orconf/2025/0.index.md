  Please make your submissions as early as you can, as the presentation slots are likely to fill up quickly.

  We aim to give as many people as possible the opportunity to present their exciting work on free and open source silicon.
  To accomodate for that we will determine the duration of a full talk once all submissions are in.
  Historically, full talks ran for 10 minutes (plus time for questions).
  Lighning talks will be 3 minutes.
  The exact amount of time you'll get will be communicated on acceptance of your talk.

  ## Sponsors

  ORConf is free to attend, but we aim to provide catering and the like during the event. ORConf is also a great way to get your company or brand in front of lots of engineers and hackers on the day, and thousands more through recordings of the event.

  Please get in touch at [orconf@fossi-foundation.org](mailto:orconf@fossi-foundation.org?subject=Sponsorship) if you'd like to explore sponsorship opportunities.

  A variety of sponsorship packages are available for this year's ORConf.

  ORConf is organized by volunteers on behalf of the FOSSi Foundation. We are currently looking for more people to help out with arrangements and putting on the event, so please do [email us](mailto:orconf@fossi-foundation.org?subject=Volunteering) if you would like to volunteer for during the event with setup, AV, or even just local knowledge so we can plan the weekend better.
