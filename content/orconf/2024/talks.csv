Fri,10:40,Normal,Using Clash to enable logically synchronous data centers,Christiaan Baaij,Tool,"The fact that all the computers and switches in a data center are mostly independent and asynchronously operating entities can cause issues. This includes a wide variance in end-to-end latency (“lag spike”), to efficient compute resource usage; and on top of that: all the buffers that are all over the place are consuming a lot of energy. Imagine, however, what would happen if you could treat your entire data center as a synchronous digital circuit: latency becomes deterministic, scheduling applications for efficient resource usage becomes easier, and you can drastically reduce buffer sizes. This is what [the Bittide project](https://www.bittide.io/), aims to achieve: to bring ‘logical’ synchrony to data centers. This talk will explain what ‘logical’ synchrony is and how we used [Clash](https://clash-lang.org/), to build the hardware support to enable it.",https://youtu.be/FylD5cWAFmg,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-SmzHF5W3eYg1MAT4oDesjG7OnOnIwJx/view?usp=sharing

Fri,11:40,Normal,FazyRV: A RISC-V Core that Scales to Your Needs,Meinhard Kissich,Core,"[FazyRV](https://github.com/meiniKi/FazyRV) is a scalable RISC-V core that can be synthesized into a (1-)bit-serial, 2-, 4-, or 8-bit-serial implementation to fulfill your performance requirements with the least area (resp. resources) demand. FazyRV provides manifold variants to adapt to the target technology by, e.g., avoiding dual-port BRAM at the cost of an additional clock cycle. Contradictory to hand-optimized cores at the gate level, FazyRV tries to avoid manual low-level optimizations to increase readability and simplify adaptations. This talk gives an insight into the open-source FazyRV core and its design objectives. We show how the area demand scales, answer why there is no 16-bit variant, discuss how the performance can be improved, and outline possible extensions to improve the current FazyRV design.",https://youtu.be/rRPVVCbpF5M,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1agGsPXyNRSzBQAJPivFP0lVqb30tZE-e/view?usp=sharing
Fri,12:00,Normal,A very small cross compiler for OpenRISC and maybe your homebrew processor,Jörg Mische,Tool,"[PunyCC](https://github.com/bobbl/punycc) is a cross compiler for a very small subset of C. Only one source file, no preprocessor, no structs, no floating point and only one datatype that can be used as unsigend int or pointer to char. Due to these simplifications the compiler source code is very small and can easily be adopted to a new target instruction set. So far PunyCC supported 4 architectures: ARM Thumb-2, RISC-V, x86-32 and WebAssembly. It can compile itself and thus provides cross compilers from any of the instruction sets to any other. This talk presents how easy it is to add OpenRISC support to PunyCC. Use it as a blueprint for porting PunyCC to your own special instruction set.",https://youtu.be/vv4WAGwwY_4,

Fri,14:20,Normal,The future of FuseSoC,Olof Kindgren,Tool,"While individual projects like Linux and GCC paved the road for open source software success, it can be argued that the thing that really enabled scaling up development of Linux-based solutions was the idea of package management. Having a common way to install software and describe their relations made it possible to rapidly create custom systems. The same can be said for language-specific package managers like pip for Python or Cargo for Rust.

On the chip design side, [FuseSoC](https://fusesoc.net/) has been doing the same thing since its inception 2011. It is by now likely the world's most widely used package manager, both for open source projects and for proprietary code.

The background of FuseSoC has been presented several times over the years, so this presentation aims to instead look ahead and see what new features that are in store for FuseSoC and its sister project Edalize.",https://youtu.be/r-oRLR1bp3I,

Sat,11:10,Normal,cocotb as a way towards a new verification methodology,Marek Cieplucha,Verification,"SystemVerilog and UVM have dominated digital verification, even though they are relatively old technologies with significant limitations.
The EDA industry's strategy has been to develop smarter (and more expensive) tools based on these technologies.
However, [Cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org/) offers a different approach. It minimizes the reliance on EDA tools (limited to just simulation) by enabling the vast capabilities of the Python ecosystem.

Is this a recipe for success? What challenges does it present? Is there room for both strategies in the future?

In this presentation, I will discuss some general considerations, as well as share experiences from successful deployments of the Cocotb flow in industrial projects (which might even be in your pocket right now).

Some fancy around-Cocotb ideas developed will be shown: usage of massive parallelism, flow unification with algorithm-level modeling and checkpointing.",https://youtu.be/h8u0Ic05zsI,

While in some ways a spiritual successor to cocotb-bus, [Forastero](https://github.com/Intuity/forastero) goes further and provides mechanisms for generating complex random stimulus. In this talk I'll present how you can use Forastero to quickly construct a testbench around a DUT, driving and monitoring multiple interfaces, and producing complex stimulus patterns. Forastero is fully open source and comes with both documentation and examples.

Sat,14:00,Normal,BYOL (Build Your Own Linter) - UVMLint for IEEE-UVM core code development,Ajeetha Kumari Venkatesan,Verification,"UVM is the most adopted design verification methodology in the field of ASIC and FPGA designs. Lint and static checking of code has proven to be very effective in projects that have wide user base, longer lifetime and distributed developers. During the recent UVM IEEE 1800.2-2023 release cycle, an observation was made regarding the potential application of a custom UVMLint solution to lint the UVM Base Class Library (BCL) as it gets developed, updated etc. We at AsFigo have developed custom rules for linting UVM BCL code on top of PySlint, an open-source SystemVerilog testbench linter. We intend to offer this as an opensource lint package to the UVM IEEE committee and to the general audience via GitHub. The eventual goal is to have these rules as gatekeepers via GitHub actions so that any future code addition to the UVM BCL is free from common pitfalls. Based on early brainstorming, below are some of the sample lint rules that are relevant to the UVM BCL codebase:

* Avoid race condition around ""static const"" (use localparam instead)
* Avoid one-liner conditional statements: 
  * `if (cond) $display (""cond"");`  
  * `if (cond) .. else $display` (""Else cond as single line""); 
  * `case..endcase` 
* Avoid one-liner code in loops: `for`, `repeat`, `while`, `do..while`, `foreach` 
* Use endlabels for elements such as `endclass`, `endfunction`, `endtask` etc.
* Flag non-virtual methods 

Typical UVMLint rules for a VIP user would be quite different from the requirements of UVM BCL. These rules are tailored for UVM BCL codebase.",,

However, the efficient utilization of RVV demands careful consideration of the optimization approach. This article examines strategies for accelerating this process. Key challenges include assessing performance differences among algorithmic approaches and overcoming initial hardware constraints. FireSim provides a comprehensive solution by offering advanced software and hardware simulation capabilities. Utilizing FireSim, we started the process of enhancing source code with RVV instructions (called vectorization) for the pixman project. Our experience outlines the efficacy of a cloud-based FPGA simulation in expediting software development for emerging ISA extensions.

Sat,15:30,Normal,Digital Signal Processing: Modeling with Julia,David Hossack,Tool,"Digital signal processing (DSP) paths are usually simulated at a high level using C or MATLAB/Simulink models to confirm basic functionality and to assess whether signal processing requirements such as frequency response and signal-to-noise ratio are being met. Complex signal processing paths consist of cascades of sigma-delta modulators, filter stages, mixers, modulators, demodulators etc each of which have a corresponding high level model. A very simple framework has been developed in Julia to enable combinations of DSP stages to be evaluated. This talk will discuss the experience of using Julia to combine models written in Julia and C, and designs written in Verilog (using Verilator) in industrial settings over many years. The principles should also be applicable to C++ or Python evaluation environments.",,
