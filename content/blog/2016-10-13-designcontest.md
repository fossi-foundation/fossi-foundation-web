This year we held the <a
href="https://librecores.org/designcontest">LibreCores Student Design
Contest</a> for the first time and it was a great success. We received
six high quality submissions of open source silicon and its ecosystem
from the last year (since October 2015).

The design contest put the focus on the openness of a design, which
includes aspects like (re-)usability, an easy entry and the potential
to build a substantial community around it.

The students had to submit their work along with answering questions
that helped understanding the project. But the main judgement was
based on the publicly available code and documentation. Beside that
students had the chance to present their work at <a
href="http://orconf.org">ORCONF 2016</a> either personally and/or with
a poster.

We are very happy we had a <a
href="https://librecores.org/designcontest">first class industry
jury</a> that evaluated the submissions. Thanks a lot to the jury
members!

Finally we got a <b>winner</b> and it is:

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/rjeady/clarvi">Clarvi - A simple
RISC-V implementation</a> by Rob Eady (Univ. of Cambridge, UK)</li>
</ul>

Beside that we decided for a "<b>special price</b> for an open source
EDA tool":

<ul>
<li> <a
href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~thuang19/software/timer/OpenTimer.html">OpenTimer:
A High-performance Timing Analysis Tool</a> by Tsung-Wei Huang
(Univ. of Illinois, USA)</li>
</ul>

We congratulate the students! It has been a hard decision as the other
submissions have been of an equally high quality:

<ul>

<li><a href="https://shashankgangrade.wordpress.com/gsoc-final/">Video
Mixing in Hardware</a> by Shashank Gangrade (Indian Institute of
Technology Bombay, IN)</li>

<li><a href="http://github.com/krevanth/ZAP">ZAP: An ARM v4 compatible
processor</a> by Revanth Kamaraj (VEDA Institute of Information
Technology, IN)</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/diadatp/nasti-ddrx-mc">nasti-ddrx-mc</a>
by Bittu N (BITS-Pilani, IN)</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/fabianschuiki/potstill">Potstill Memory
Generator</a> by Fabian Schuiki (ETH Zurich, CH)</li>

</ul>

Thanks a lot for the great submissions! The call for next year will be
released over the next weeks.
