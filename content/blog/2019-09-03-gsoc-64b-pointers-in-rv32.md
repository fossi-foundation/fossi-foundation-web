*This is a guest post by Reshabh Sharma, who worked this summer on a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project under the umbrella of the FOSSi Foundation.*

RISC-V will change the world. Prof Taylor's [Bespoke Silicon Group][bespoke-silicon-group] is contributing by developing a GP-GPU based on RISC-V 32 bit ISA (RV32), after the huge success of their Open-Source RISC-V Tiered Accelerator Fabric SoC, [Celerity][celerity] which holds the world record for RISC-V performance; 500B RISC-V instructions per second, beating prior records by 100X.

For compute 32 bit is common for requirements like very high energy efficiency and density. Since GPGPUs often requires 4GB+ of memory, we need 64 bit addresses to access DRAM. This summer I worked under the vision of Prof. Taylor to initiate the support for custom instructions specifically designed for [RISC-V based GP-GPU][basejump]. We started with supporting 64 bit pointers using custom load and store instructions in address space 1 inside the RISC-V LLVM backend.

### Getting Started
Our RISC-V LLVM backend fork is available [here][rv32-gpu]. Get started by building LLVM with our custom RISC-V backend fork following the steps given [here][get-started]. 

### Custom Instructions
Following new instructions have been added:
- LDW rd, rs1, rs2
Loads the value from a 64 bit address by concating the i32 values in two registers.
-  SDW rd, rs1, rs2
Stores the value to a 64 bit address by concating the i32 values in two registers.

### Phase 1: Define new instructions
This phase was fairly simple and dealt with the addition of new instructions in RISCV LLVM backend.

### Phase 2: Update data layout string
Data layout string conveys the front-end about the size and alignments of different entities like integers, pointers etc. We updated the data layout string to support 64 bit pointers in address space 1.

### Phase 3: Lowering to custom load and store
Lowering to custom store was a huge challange and I'm glad that we could complete it. More information about the challanges we faced during lowering can be found at this [blog post][lower-custom]

### Conclusion
It was a wonderful experience working under the mentorship of Prof. Taylor. I also appriciate all the efforts from [Neil Ryan](https://neildryan.com/) and the awesome collaboration with [Bespoke Silicon Group][bespoke-silicon-group]. The task was complex and looked hard to be completed in the given time frame, I'm glad we did it. I've got a lot of help from llvm-dev mailing list, riscv-llvm group especially Alex Bradbury and Lu√≠s Marques who are still helping us to run perf benchmark on spike. Million thanks to everyone who supported us. Feel free to reach out at reshabhsh@gmail.com for any feedback/suggestions.
