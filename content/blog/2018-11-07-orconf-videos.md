ORConf 2018 was a great success, with many fantastic talks, hallway discussions, and valuable insights into other projects.
If you couldn't attend, or if you need a refresher on how great the talks were, don't dispair: the videos and slides are now available online!

Thanks to the hard work of Simon Cook who did all the video editing, you can watch (almost) all talks [on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUg3wIOWD8yoZLznLfhXjlICGlx2tuwvT). 

The slides are also available online for most talks, find them next to the talk descriptions on the [ORConf page](https://orconf.org).

That's it for the moment, enjoy! We are currently in the process of collecting location proposals for the next ORConf, so if you have an intersting location available and would like to host ORConf next year please get in touch with us!
