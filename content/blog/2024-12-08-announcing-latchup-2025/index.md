The FOSSi Foundation is proud to announce [Latch-Up 2025](/latch-up/2025), a conference dedicated to free and open source silicon to be held over the weekend of May 2-4 in Santa Barbara, CA, USA.

Following up on the fantastic event we had at MIT [last year](/latch-up/2024) we set the sight on the US West coast this year, but in all other regards it will be a familiar setup in the spirit of previous Latch-Up and our long-running [ORConf](/orconf).

Latch-Up is a community-focused conference for open source semiconductor, digital design and embedded systems professionals and enthusiasts. Expect presentations on a wide range of topics; open source IP blocks and SoCs, open source simulators, compilers, synthesis and physical implementation tools for both FPGA and ASIC.

## What is Latch-Up?

Technically speaking, latch-up is a short circuit, an inadvertent path of low-impedance. We have co-opted this word to represent what we’d like to encourage among members of the community: paths of communication leading to collaboration, inadvertent or not.

Latch-Up brings together open source digital design community in North America for an event in the mould of ORConf - the FOSSi Foundation’s annual European community conference. Like ORConf, Latch-Up is free to attend and consist of a relaxed format of presentations and discussions throughout a weekend, with plenty of time for networking.

These events go to the FOSSi Foundations’ goal of lowering barriers of entry to the digital design field, whilst encouraging the open source development model and promoting open collaboration.

## Visiting Latch-Up

The event will be free of charge but attendees are required to register. Registration will open soon.

## Speaking at Latch-Up

We invite anyone who is involved in any aspect of open source digital design and embedded systems engineering to join us to present their work.

All presentations at Latch-Up will be recorded (with your permission) and posted on the FOSSi Foundation’s YouTube channel after the event.

## Supporting Latch-up

Latch-Up is free of charge to attend, but not free to run.
Events like Latch-Up are a great way to get your brand in front of a passionate audience of engineers. Please get in touch if you’d like to view our sponsorship packages and help make Latch-Up a success.

We also need folks on the ground to lend a hand - so if you have any expertise in helping to run or staff such events, your help would be greatly appreciated, so please do [get in touch](latch-up@fossi-foundation.org) to let us know you’d like to help out.

## When and where

The conference will be held during the weekend May 2-4 2025 at University of California, Santa Barbara, USA.
