It has happened folks, another [ORConf](/orconf/2025) is behind us and we're all
safely home thinking about yet another brilliant installment of
Europe's premiere open source silicon design conference. On behalf of
the FOSSi Foundation I'd like to thank all who attended, spoke,
sponsored, donated and hosted for your involvement with the event – you helped make it run flawlessly under the baking Valencian sun.

The major theme of the year for me, and evidenced by the day and a
half of talks in the schedule, was EDA and tooling. We saw all manner
of tools for every facet of the open source silicon design flow.
Design, verification, simulation, results viewing and tracking,
synthesis and optimization, place and route, timing closure, DRC and
automation of all of the above were covered by the presentations we
heard over the two days. Looking back 10 years ago (incidentally, to
the very same ORConf where the FOSSi Foundation was hatched in 2015,
ORConf 2015) it was the other way around: three quarters talks on
design IP, one quarter tooling. A testament to a decade delivering
repositories of incredible IP now gone, and focus having shifted
towards tooling and enabling taping open source designs with open
source tools. Incredible.

For those not talking about tooling, it was an equally strong showing
yet again; open embedded FPGA fabric and SRAM generators were two
standouts in my mind for highly complex IP strands which are maturing
rapidly. We received another great update on Tiliqua, the open source
DSP platform + video DJ project, to close out the main speaking track
of the event. This year also saw us hold a new segment at the end of
each day; interviews with some titans of the open source semiconductor
space recorded as a podcast, so keep an eye out for announcements
regarding the release of these!

Our hosts at the Universitat Politècnica de València, in particular
Carles Hernandez Luz and local hero Matt Venn and all of the
volunteers who helped, put on a fantastic show. We gorged on delicious
Valencian cuisine all weekend long and were treated to an excellent
conference dinner on the Saturday evening in the warm evening air. Yet
again this year lightning talks were held after dinner, with glasses
charged. This was the furthest south in Europe we've held ORConf, and
the first on the Mediterranean coast, and I suspect the conclusion is
we'd be happy to repeat it in such a warm and welcoming environment.

It was great to see so many familiar faces again, and meet plenty of
new ones as always. The conference was as well attended as it's ever
been, with over 120 folks in attendance at its peak. Thanks to all who
took time out of your busy lives and travelled from near and far to
spend the three days with us. Once again the "hallway track" was as busy
as ever all weekend long. We were overwhelmed by the presentation
submissions and had to keep the talk durations short and sharp, and
timing precise, so thanks for helping us get through a record number
of presentations across the two days of main talks track.

All talks are now up on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUg3wIOWD8yqNPXlOrzqeEoO52koaqVhR) for your viewing pleasure. Thanks to
our AV team at the FOSSi Foundation, led by Simon Cook who was at the
helm of the video console all weekend, and who yet again got the talks
uploaded within minutes of their completion in the room.

A big thank you to the event's sponsors, who shall remain enshrined on
the [ORConf 2025 website forever](/orconf/2025) more, and thank you to all who donated
via registration, you all contributed to covering the costs which
means we can keep the event free, comfortable and convenient to attend
for all.

As ever the volunteers who help run the FOSSi Foundation deserve a big
shout out: Philipp, Matt, Stefan, Olof, Simon, Andrew, you helped make
it happen, great work. We're super pleased to be able to run an event
that gets such a positive response from the community, and to be able
to make a contribution in this way.

Finally, we hope to see you all again soon. We're still figuring out
where we'll be next time around so keep an eye out for announcements.
Until then, adios.
