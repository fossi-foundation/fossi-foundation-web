[ORConf](https://www.orconf.org) is back! We've returned with yet another open source chip
design tour de force courtesy of the brilliant community, our first
since the previous outing in Bordeaux in 2019. The years have been
kind, it seems to us all; with much progress to be presented and
discussed over the three days being hosted by the
University of Applied Sciences in beautiful Munich.

We were very pleased to have Andrew Kahng open the show with updates
on the impressive developments in [OpenROAD's](https://theopenroadproject.org/) place-and-route
capabilities, continuing to pave the way for truly open source chip
design.

Plenty of virtual prototyping news, and a fascinating presentation on
laser attacks determining not only circuit structure but run-time
values. Stafford Horne gave us the annual [OpenRISC](https://openrisc.io/) update; plenty
since Bordeaux including simulator improvements, specification updates
and continued support in the Linux kernel, all major tool chains and C
libraries. Karol Gugala of Antmicro shared their work with the [CHIPS Alliance](https://www.chipsalliance.org/) on tooling which is always impressive to see and of course
widely used by the community.

LowRISC's Greg Chadwick joined us for a keynote on the state of their
work, including having taped out [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org/), continuing to keep [Ibex](https://ibex-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
improving, and future work they're undertaking; all fantastic to see.
Continuing the security theme; Michael Gielda gave us the lowdown on
another root-of-trust development in Caliptra, Felix Oberhansl
analysing the RISC-V crypto extensions and how much they speed up
software implementations, and Leon Woestenberg showing off their
hardware-based (although originally RISC-V-in-the-loop) WireGuard
implementation for high throughput ethernet networks.

Rihards Novickis brought up healthy debate about how Europe will
implement the goal of its Chips Act, and what role FOSSi tools and
designs can play in that - something which is very topical, and on the
topic of which we will draw the attention of those interested to this
[workshop](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/EUCADP923) which is
coming up soon.

The folks from [ASTRON](https://www.astron.nl/) in the Netherlands shared details of their data
transport implementations and other IP they are open sourcing which is
great to see. Tomasz Hemperek of Cocotb maintainer fame, shared his
verification flow and methodology for improving development speed and
quality.

[Cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org) is definitely not dead; and in fact appears to be in rude
health with a presentation on the latest and greatest from Philipp
Wagner, and followed by an unconference on cocotb on Sunday, bringing
together the brains trust to plot world domination one API improvement
at a time.

The folks of [AsFigo](https://asfigo.com/) shared their thoughts on testbench linting and
maths libraries in System Verilog. Charlos Papon showed us some
details on his Spinal HDL interconnect generator using TileLink.

Closing out the event's formal proceedings in style, as always, was
Davide Rossi, with a retrospective on the decade-long [PULP project](https://iis-projects.ee.ethz.ch/index.php/PULP);
starting out with their humble beginnings working with OpenRISC CPUs
and the inevitable switch to RISC-V, and a recap of the incredible
architectural research work they've done and what is coming up. This
is truly a remarkable research group who generate some very widely
used IP and tooling and we're honoured to have hosted Davide a decade
back in Cambridge and to have him join us this year to recap 10 years
of work. Grazie Davide!

ORConf wouldn't be ORConf without plenty of social time, and this year
we were treated to a couple of fantastic evening events in different
sides of Munich. Great food and libations were on offer and we all
hung out and chatted long into the evening, rapidly making up for 4
years between drinks.

Munich was in fine form this weekend, sunshine and warm weather were
very welcome, and provided a great backdrop to a fantastic event.

A big thank you to the hosts and the folks who helped out running the
show. An even bigger thank you to the attendees and presenters. The
biggest thanks to professional ticket holder and our sponsors [Antmicro](https://antmicro.com/), [Axelera](http://www.axelera.ai/), [lowRISC](https://www.lowrisc.org), [Minres](http://www.minres.com/) and [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/) who help
make this event possible.

**All recordings of the talks are now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUg3wIOWD8yqkkVd286RIiAxE1ppAJp2j).**
