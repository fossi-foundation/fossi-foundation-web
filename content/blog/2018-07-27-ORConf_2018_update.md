This year's [ORConf](https://orconf.org) is but 8 weeks away and we're pleased to announce that we
have another great event lined up for everyone.

First, I'd like to announce and publicly thank our major sponsor this year; Google. In addition to
them I'd like to thank [AntMicro](http://www.antmicro.com/) and Rick O'Connor and the [RISC-V
Foundation](http://riscv.org/) for their continued support of ORConf.

Already we have a [fantastic lineup of presentations](https://orconf.org/#presentations) in store; Wilson
Snyder's presentation on [Verilator 4.0](https://orconf.org/#verilator4), Tim Ansell's talk on
[SymbiFlow](https://orconf.org/#symbiflow), [an update on the OpenRISC project](https://orconf.org/#orupdate) from Stafford Horne, talks on
[SpinalHDL](https://orconf.org/#spinalhdl), [OpenSoC Debug](https://orconf.org/#opensocdebug), an
update on the [ZipCPU](https://orconf.org/#zipcpu), [retargeting CPUs to RISC-V](https://orconf.org/#retarget), [Clash](https://orconf.org/#clash), and [Project Trellis](https://orconf.org/#trellis)!

There is more to come too, in particular plans are afoot for a workshop on the RISC-V based [PULP platform](https://www.pulp-platform.org/). 
Details on this will be revaled in the coming weeks. To
stay in the loop, subscribe to the [orconf-announce list](https://lists.librecores.org/listinfo/orconf-announce).

If you'd like to present at ORConf please submit a proposal via [this
form](https://goo.gl/forms/sP5otWAbv72gheU33). ORConf's audience would love to hear from users
and developers of open source digital design (FOSSi) cores, tools and systems alike.

If you plan on joining us then please do [register to attend](https://goo.gl/forms/96HgBQGARX8R1Lmk2) -
it's free to come ot ORConf but we'd like to at least know how many people are coming on which days.

ORConf will continue to be free to attend, and we're on the look-out for potential sponsors of this
year's event. Please [get in touch](mailto:orconf@fossi-foundation.org) if you'd like to find out
more about our sponsorship packages.

As usual the [ORConf.org site](https://orconf.org) will always have the most up to date information.

Thanks for reading and we look forward to seeing everyone in ORConf in September!
