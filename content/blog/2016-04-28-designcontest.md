The FOSSi foundation launches an annual student design contest, which
will run for the first time this year. You can find the full
announcement [here](http://librecores.org/designcontest).

As this is the first run, we are open to any kind of submission:
Undergraduate or PhD project, a hardware design or useful tool, etc.
The focus of this design contest is beyond the actual design,
excellent entries should be open, reusable and useful. Especially
aspects like documentation, quick start, testbenches, etc. are
valuated highly in this contest.

The best entries will be granted travel grants to this years ORCONF
where they can present their work in a lightning talk and during a
poster session.  We are still fixing a jury of industry experts, but
people from large semiconductor and EDA companies have already agreed
to be part of it.

If you are interested to participate, please be invited to submit your
work since last October to our mail address or ask for feedback on a new
project on our [mailing list](/getinvolved.html).

Thanks go to our academic partners that help us with organization of
this contest.
