After two months months of discussion and planning FOSSi Foundation is
making a lot of progress recently. Most importantly we are now
officially
[registered](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09848956) as a
*Community Interest Company (CIC)* in the UK. This is a proper legal
body that we have chosen to run an independent, community-based
foundation. We are still in the process of opening a bank account
which seems to be more complex with our international officers.

On Saturday, the FOSSi Foundation will present itself at
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2016/) in the
[main tracks](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/digital_hardware_design/)
at Saturday morning. We are looking forward to meeting you there!

Our most important roadmap item is the development of a web platform
that serves as the community hub for Free and Open Source
Silicon. This platform has a name now: *LibreCores*. Stay tuned, there
will be some things going on in the next months!

Finally, find a short [introduction into FOSSi](/fossi.html) that
highlights the differences to Open Source Software and the maker
scene. We are steadily working in making FOSSi the same success.
