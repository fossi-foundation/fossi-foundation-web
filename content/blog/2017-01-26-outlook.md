The first full year of the FOSSi Foundation is over and looking back
on 2016 we are proud about our achievements:

 * We have launched [LibreCores.org](http://librecores.org), our
   modern approach on a community portal for free and open source
   silicon.

 * We organized a well attended [ORCONF](http://orconf.org/2016) in
   Bologna with many interesting talks from a variety of projects.

 * We got involved with the community, e.g., by giving
   [talks at FOSDEM](/2016/01/28/update) and
   [FrOSCon](/2016/08/16/froscon), as the umbrella for FOSSi-related
   projects in [Google Summer of Code](2016/07/31/gsocupdate) and on
   many other occasions.

We are confident we successfully layed the groundwork for our plans
for 2017. This year will be of scaling our resources and committee
work. Our plans are:

 * Extending the feature set of LibreCores.org. You can find our
   roadmap [here](https://www.librecores.org/static/about).

 * One of the most exciting upcoming features of LibreCores.org is our
   [continuous integration](https://www.librecores.org/static/librecores-ci)
   platform, that can be used to automatically execute simulations,
   synthesis and tests for the projects listed on LibreCores.org.

 * Our licensing committee is working on formulating recommendations
   for FOSSi licensing for the three dominant license types:
   permissive, weak copyleft and strong copyleft.

 * We will host another ORCONF this year and will soon announce it.

 * Of course the involvement with the community by meeting people at
   conferences, presenting our work and getting the word spread.

We are looking forward to this year and would like to hear your
feedback on our plans. Please [get involved!](/getinvolved.html).

Finally, we are searching for sponsors to support our efforts. While
the directors are volunteering, there is an increasing cost involved
with running the projects. Please contact us at
[sponsoring@fossi-foundation.org](mailto:sponsoring@fossi-foundation.org)
to discuss sponsorship and how our work also benefits your company.
