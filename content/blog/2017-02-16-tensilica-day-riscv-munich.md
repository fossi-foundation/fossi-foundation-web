Today I visited Hanover to talk at the Tensilica Day 2017. I was
invited by the Cadence Academic Network to give some insights into the
state of open source processors and FOSSi. The audience was mainly
academic and working on application-specific instruction-set
processors (ASIP) and hence some thoughts about the open source
ecosystem were welcome very much. It was an interesting event and I
had some great discussions. Please find my slides
[here](https://speakerdeck.com/wallento/the-state-of-open-source-processors-and-open-source-silicon).

As another great update we announce an event organized by us in
Munich, Germany, on March 23:
[Open Source Silicon with RISC-V](/riscv-munich). Krste Asanovic will
speak about [RISC-V](http://riscv.org), Rob Mullins and Alex Bradbury
about [lowRISC](http://lowrisc.org), and I will give a brief overview
of why and how the FOSSi Foundation operates. If you live nearby,
please come by and don't forget to [register](/riscv-munich).
