Today the [OpenHW Group](https://www.openhwgroup.org) was
announced. This is yet another great step for Free and Open Source
Silicon. With the rise of RISC-V we have seen some great momentum
beyond the processor cores itself. We now see groups growing from and
around the RISC-V ecosystem with big players involved. This strongly
confirms our story and we look forward to the next months of
continuous growth of the FOSSi community.

The OpenHW Group is backed for example by Alibaba, NXP, Thales and
Silicon Labs, with a total of 13 sponsors. The goal is to create a set
of industry-standard high-quality processor core IP blocks, named
CORE-V. FOSSi Foundation is partnering with the OpenHW and we will
support the OpenHW Group, especially about the involvement with the
larger community.

We are looking forward to working together with the OpenHW Group to
sustainably grow the FOSSi ecosystem.
