One of our main projects is [LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org), a
community portal for open source digital designs.

[LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org) is currently under development
and needs constant improvement. We are always searching for developers
that are interested to contribute to the development of
[LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org). From designing, to writing of
documentation and code, to testing: there are opportunities to contribute from
small to large, from novice to experienced programmer, writer or designer.

Right now we're especially looking for people who have experience with the
design of web sites using the [Symfony PHP framework](http://symfony.com/),
and associated frontend technolgies such as HTML and JavaScript.

If you are interested and want to contribute, please have a look at our
[contribution guide](http://librecores-web.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html).

*Job Offer* We have funds allocated for the development and search for
 contractors for the aforementioned tasks. If you want to work for us
 instead of casually contributing (which can also complement each
 other) and share our values and goals, please get in touch at
 [librecores@fossi-foundation.org](mailto:librecores@fossi-foundation.org).
