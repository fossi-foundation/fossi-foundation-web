[ORConf](https://orconf.org) 2017 came to a close last Sunday, and on
behalf of the FOSSi Foundation I'd like to thank all who attended,
[presented](https://orconf.org/#presentations) and
[sponsored](https://orconf.org/#sponsors) the event!

Hebden Bridge was a fantastic setting; a beautiful northern English
town nestled in a valley, complete with gushing river, canals with
narrowboats, verdant hillsides and northern stone buildings.
The Hebden Bridge town hall was a great venue, recently renovated,
we were hosted in the Waterfront Hall which provided the sound of
the river flowing past all day. Oh, and an amazing courtyard in
which a few beers were enjoyed between talks.

From all accounts, the preceding week's events at
[Wuthering Bytes](http://wutheringbytes.com/) had been a great
success, with several from [Chip Hack](http://chiphack.org/)
staying on to attend ORConf and hopefully had a better understanding
of what was going on thanks to their nascent Verilog coding skills.

The 3-day ORConf schedule provided a non-stop tour de force of
the best minds and projects among the open source digital design
community. Open source EDA had another strong showing with many
presentations on automation be it IP-XACT, verification frameworks,
flows and continuous integration.

It was great to receive updates on the various RISC-V projects in
motion around the continent such as [lowRISC](https://lowrisc.org)
and [PULP](http://www.pulp-platform.org/) and Clifford Wolf's [latest
efforts](https://orconf.org/#riscvformal) in his formal verification
tool being deployed on the RISC-V ISA.

One highlight for me was meeting the man behind
[Open Circuit Design](http://opencircuitdesign.com/), Tim Edwards, and
hearing about his latest venture with [efabless](http://efabless.com/),
in particular their IP design and fabrication model and getting an
understanding of just how truly accessible open source semiconductor
design is today. We look forward to hearing from efabless again in
the coming years.

As always it was a pleasure to see so many new faces and hear about
projects we didn't really know about, and also how much interest from
industry there is in this area. A licensing update from Andrew Katz
was also encouraging, showing the efforts of CERN and the FOSSi Foundation
in the area of HDL licensing are beginning to take shape. Another
great moment was Richard Herveille talking about the early days
of OpenCores.org and his involvement with the project, fascinating stuff
to many of us who were only involved later.

The Saturday evening dinner event, which was sponsored by
[RS Components](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/), was thoroughly enjoyed
by all accounts, as were Hebden Bridge's many fine pubs, treating us all
to fine pints of real English ale throughout the weekend.

As we look back on this year's conference, we're already looking forward to
2018's which we're pleased to say planning is already underway
for. We'll hopefully announce the date well in advance to permit early
travel bookings.

I'm very pleased to mention that ORConf has received a couple of mentions
on the web so far, so if you're interested in more please do check out
the following articles on the
[ZipCPU blog](http://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/09/12/orconf-2017-return-home.html)

A big thank you once again to our [sponsors](https://orconf.org/#sponsors)
this year, and to Judith Jones, Sarah Cook, Simon Cook and rest of the crew
from [Embecosm](http://www.embecosm.com/) who made things a breeze this year.

Don't forget to check [the ORConf site](https://orconf.org) for links to
videos when they're available, and slide decks from the presentations.

We're looking forward to seeing everyone at ORConf 2018!
