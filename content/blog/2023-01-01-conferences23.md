We announced in [ECL 57](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/2022/12/12/ecl57) our North American open source silicon conference "Latch-Up" will return in 2023. And it will be joined by another edition of ORConf!

[**Latch-Up 2023**](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/latchup/) will be held at the University of California, Santa Barbara on March 31st to April 2nd

[**ORConf 2023**](https://orconf.org) will be held in Munich, Germany on September 15th to September 17th

One of our main ambitions is to hold community events as a melting pot of projects from hobbyists, industry and academia. They are well-recognized and popular due to their informal nature, and probably the prime vendor-neutral events in the open source silicon space.

Presentation submissions and registration for Latch-Up have already started, ORConf will be open to submissions soon too. We welcome any presentation in the space of open source silicon, open source EDA design tools, community building and beyond, either in the form of full presentations or as lightning talks.

As always, the events are **free to attend**! To cover some of the costs we invite you to buy professional tickets, especially if you can reimburse them with your company.

Finally, we are looking for sponsors and have some great deals to show your support for this thriving community. [Please get in touch if you are interested!](mailto:info@fossi-foundation.org?Subject=Event Sponsorship)

Looking forward to meeting you in Santa Barbara or Munich!
