As summer comes to an end, we have also completed this year's iteration of Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
We at FOSSi Foundation are delighted to say that all of our students this summer successfully completed their projects.
For multiple years now, FOSSi Foundation has acted as an umbrella organization for GSoC projects and this year we were particularly excited to have eleven students receiving mentorship from our community.
All projects were mentored by trusted community members, including seven first-time FOSSi GSoC mentors, and we are extremely happy with how well the projects went!
We owe a big thank you to all students and mentors: Thanks to you, the free and open source silicon ecosystem is in a better place than before.
Below is a collection of links to our students' final project blog posts.
Please have a read and join us in congratulating them on such a successful summer!
We hope to see you all again for next year's GSoC.
