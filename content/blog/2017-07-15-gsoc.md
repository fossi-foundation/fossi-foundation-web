We are six weeks into Google Summer of Code now and have seen some
great progress from our students. The goal of Google Summer of Code is
to get students involved in open source communities, which is very
valuable for communities of a size like ours.

In the following I want to summarize the progress of the students and
where to find the work and documentation. We are looking forward to a
successful second half of Google Summer of Code.

## Code quality metrics for projects listed on LibreCores.org

Student: Amitosh Swain Mahapatra

The goal of Amitosh's project is to display useful information of a
project activity and metadata on LibreCores.org. Beside that he has
made significant contributions to the general setup of
LibreCores.org. His contributions so far led to 5 pull requests into
the main code base:
[#145](https://github.com/librecores/librecores-web/pull/145),
[#147](https://github.com/librecores/librecores-web/pull/147),
[#149](https://github.com/librecores/librecores-web/pull/149),
[#150](https://github.com/librecores/librecores-web/pull/150),
[#152](https://github.com/librecores/librecores-web/pull/152)

You can follow Amitosh's work on
[gitter](https://gitter.im/librecores/Lobby),
[the librecores dev mailing list](https://lists.librecores.org/listinfo/dev)
and most importantly his [blog](https://amitosh.in). Also see his
[latest blog post](https://amitosh.in/stories/2017/07/02/one-month-of-gsoc-with-fossi/).

## EDSAC Museum on FPGA

Student: Hatim Kanchwala

Hatim works on replicating one of the first generation tube-based
computers, the EDSAC. The goal is to bring it up on the MyStorm FPGA
board. He makes great progress on replicating the machine and the
results will become a [ChipHack](http://chiphack.org/) workshop in
September around [ORConf](https://orconf.org).

You can best follow Hatim's work on
[his Github repository](https://github.com/librecores/gsoc-museum-edsac),
on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/librecores/gsoc-museum-edsac) and on his
[blog](https://hatimak.me/notes/gsoc-community-bonding/).

## Integration of OpenRISC Linux Port into OpTiMSoC

Student: Pedro Henrique Penna

Pedro works on porting OpenRISC Linux into the
[Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip](https://optimsoc.org). Linux runs
in a specialized subsystem that interacts with the user and a driver
encapsulates the communication with the other processing resources.

Pedro works on
[a series of Github repositories](https://github.com/ppenna?tab=repositories)
to fulfill this task and you can best interact with him on
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/optimsoc/Lobby).

## Updating Sodor

Student: Kritik Bhimani

Kritik proposed to update the
[Sodor](https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-sodor) repository of RISC-V
teaching cores to the recent RISC-V specifications and an updated
major version of the [Chisel](http://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/)
hardware construction language. This task has a very high impact as
many people are interested in this repository to get started with
RISC-V.

You can best follow Kritik's work in his
[repository](https://github.com/librecores/riscv-sodor) and on
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/librecores/riscv-sodor). Kritik has
recently created a larger
[pull request](https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-sodor/pull/23) with
the majority of the tasks completed and documents his work on his
[blog](https://codelec.github.io/).

## High-level bitstream format for Lattice iCE40 FPGAs

Student: Roland Lutz

Roland works on the icestorm FPGA implementation flow and targets at a
high-level description of the bitstream as a more useful,
human-readable representation. He also works on improving the
documentation of the tool.

Roland works on his
[Github repository](https://github.com/rlutz/icestorm) and recently
got his first
[pull request](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm/pull/82) into
icestorm.
