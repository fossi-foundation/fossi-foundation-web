[LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org) is a modern portal for Free
and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi). Our aim is that it becomes the entry
point to find and promote high quality free and open source digital IP
blocks, free and open source platforms and free and open EDA
tools. The focus is on user collaboration, for example by
recommendations, and providing a simple interface to understand the
fitness of a project.

[LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org) is currently under
development and needs constant improvement. In the next future we plan
extensions to the user interaction, an open API, improved search and
listing, and we will get into the alpha phase for our
[continuous integration (LibreCores CI)](https://www.librecores.org/static/librecores-ci).

We are always searching for developers that are interested to
contribute to the development of
[LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org):

 * Frontend designers and programmers

 * Backend designers, ideally experienced with
[Symfony PHP framework](http://symfony.com/)

 * Jenkins/Groovy developers and testers for LibreCores CI

If you are interested and want to contribute, please have a look at
our
[contribution guide](http://librecores-web.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html).

## Job Offer

We have funds allocated for the development of LibreCores.org and
search for contractors for the aforementioned tasks. If you want to
work for us instead of casually contributing (which can also
complement each other) and share our values and goals, please get in
touch at
[librecores@fossi-foundation.org](mailto:librecores@fossi-foundation.org).
