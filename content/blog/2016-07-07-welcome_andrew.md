We are delighted to announce that well-known Open Source evangelist [Andrew Back](/about-us/core-team) has joined the FOSSi Foundation board of directors.

With a long history in managing Open Source communities and bringing them together with the tech industry as well as being the founder of the Wuthering Bytes festival we hope to also reach a wider audience interested in Open Source Silicon.

Welcome Andrew!
