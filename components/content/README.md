# Nuxt Content-specific Vue components

All `Prose*` components adjust the default rendering of Nuxt Content, i.e. all
(Markdown) pages in `content/`.
The components are originally copied from
https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc/blob/main/src/runtime/components/prose and
should be kept in sync with the upstream ones.
